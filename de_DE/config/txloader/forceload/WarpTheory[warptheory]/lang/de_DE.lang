# << hunk of something >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.something=Hunk of Something
tc.research_text.warptheory.something=Definitely not something pleasant
research.warptheory.warpsomething=By chance you realized that many simple meats could be transmuted into something else if they were exposed to eldritch energy. It's... probably not a good idea to look too closely at the result.

# << Impure tear >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.cleanserminor=Impure Tear
tc.research_text.warptheory.cleanserminor=Magical-ish Medicine
research.warptheory.warpcleanserminor=You've dealt with warp long enough, time to try to find a way to get rid of it. You decide to try mixing together some cleansing type items you've found.<BR>You succeeded, but the effect only works when you have a decent amount of it, so you can't get rid of it all. But at least you can avoid the worst effects, unlike Bob who had a wither spawn and blow up his base. Poor Bob. (You need 50+ warp for it to work, and it removes 5 warp)<BR>You suspect that if you had better materials, you could make a better version.

# << pure tear >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.cleanser=Pure Tear
tc.research_text.warptheory.cleanser=Magical Medicine
research.warptheory.warpcleanser=By combining the curative properties of Ghast Tears, the magical energy of Salis Mundus, and the stabilizing properties of crystals, you've discovered a means of purging negative magical energy from the body.<BR>The process is not without drawbacks, though, as all that energy has to go somewhere.

# << purification talisman >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.amulet=Purification Talisman
tc.research_text.warptheory.amulet=More than a simple good luck charm
research.warptheory.amulet=You've discovered a process by which the purifying properties of Pure Tears can be channeled over time without the requisite indigestion they cause.<BR>By simply setting two opposing tears into an amulet and imbuing it with certain magic, an accessory which continuously siphons off negative magical energy into the environment is produced.

# << litmus paper >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.paper=Arcane Litmus Paper
tc.research_text.warptheory.paper=Almost scientific
research.warptheory.paper=You've decided that you'll need something somewhat more accurate than counting the strange events that happen around you to gauge the buildup of negative magical energy in your body.<BR>By imbuing some paper with Salis Mundus and the essence of water, you've created a means to get a read on just how much danger you've been exposing yourself to.
