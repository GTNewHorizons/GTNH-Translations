thaumicenergistics.research_page.TECORES.1=Having discovered how to distill essentia, it occurs to you that you may be able store it digitally.<BR>Examining the §lFormation Core§r and §lAnnihilation Core§r you realize that with some minor modifications they could serve as a means to convert essentia to and from a digital format.<BR>However, due to the corrosive nature of certain types of essentia, a layer of quicksilver around the circuitry is required to prevent decay.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TECORES.2=§lDiffusion Core§r<BR>The relatively high volatility and immense energy in distilled essentia requires that it first be diffused then digitized. A buffer chamber of some kind will likely be required to hold the diffused essentia.<LINE>§lCoalescence Core§r<BR>Compresses and binds re-materialized essentia diffusion back into its raw form. A buffer chamber will also likely be needed.

thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSTERM.1=The §lEssentia Terminal§r provides a convenient way to insert or extract essentia stored within the network.<BR>When placing a jar or phial it will be emptied if it contains any essentia, or filled with the selected aspect. Labels can also be set or cleared depending on the selected aspect.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSTERM.2=For the Thaumaturge with little time on their hands and many aspects to work with, the displayed aspects can be clicked with an item to fill, drain, or set the item in question.<BR>When holding multiple of an item, items will be returned to your inventory.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSTERM.3=The §lEssentia Level Emitter§r provides a redstone signal when the level of essentia in the network falls below or rises above a set amount.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSTERM.4=The §lEssentia Storage Monitor§r & §lEssentia Conversion Monitor§r allow you to see how much of an aspect is in the network at a glance. The conversion monitor also allows you to insert and extract essentia from the network.<BR>Right-clicking with a wrench will lock/unlock the monitor.<BR>Right-clicking an unlocked monitor with a label or filled jar or phial will set the displayed aspect, and right-clicking with an empty hand will clear aspect.<BR>Right-clicking a locked conversion monitor will fill jar or phial and Shift-Right-Clicking will empty them.<BR>Shift-Double-Right-Click will empty all essentia from your inventory.

# Research Essentia Provider
tc.research_name.thaumicenergistics.TEESSPROV=Essentia Provider
tc.research_text.thaumicenergistics.TEESSPROV=Ask and you shall receive.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSPROV.1=While import and export buses are useful for an array of jobs, they lack the flexibility to interface with complex alchemical constructs. To overcome this limitation you have created a device that will allow these constructs to request any essentia directly from the network.<BR>Using the §lEssentia Provider§r should prove to be a simple task. Simply connect it to both the network and construct, and it will do the rest.<BR>Like an essentia buffer it has a small amount of suction(8).

tc.research_text.thaumicenergistics.TEVISINT=Using Vis Digitally
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEVISINT.1=Having discovered the vis power network, you now pursue the means of linking your digital system to this network.<BR>After observing how vis flows through the network of §lvis relays§r, you believe you can construct a digital device to harness the vis. By utilizing the peer-to-peer capabilities of the digital network, vis can be imported, tunnelled, and used by your digital devices.<BR>Storing it however, will require more research.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEVISINT.2=To use the §lVis Relay Interface§r, attach it to the digital network and place a vis relay on it. The base of the relay must be against the interface.<BR>In order for a device to receive vis it must be linked with the interface. Linking other devices to the interface will require the use of a §lMemory Card§r. Each device can only be linked with one interface.<BR>Shift right-click on the interface with a memory card, then right-click on a device to create the link.<BR>Right clicking the other device with a blank memory card will remove the link.

thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEIRONGEARBOX.1=Your experiences with the §lWooden Crank§r has left you to wonder, could this be improved?<BR>You have devised a way of setting up a series of gears in a box so that when any side is turned, all other sides will also turn. However you will need a stronger material than wood, to that end you have created the §lIron Gear§r by bonding iron to a wooden gear.<BR>The §lIron Gear Box§r will allow you to crank multiple devices simultaneously. You will need to orient the devices so that their input faces the gearbox.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEIRONGEARBOX.2=When cranking multiple devices, such as a two grinders & a charger, the crank power will be split evenly between all devices that are currently able to be cranked.<BR>Another advantage of the gearbox is that it can be used by multiple people simultaneously. Each person cranking the gearbox will add to the crank power output.<BR>Now if only you had someone who would stand around all day and crank this for you...

thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEKNOWLEDGEINSCRIBER.1=With the §lArcane Assembler§r constructed, you will need a way to teach it what it will be assembling.<BR>You have devised the §lKnowledge Core§r, a device capable of storing arcane recipes. The core serves as pattern storage, giving the assembler instructions on how to build items.<BR>To encode recipe patterns on the core, you will need to use the §lKnowledge Inscriber§r.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEKNOWLEDGEINSCRIBER.2=Using The §lKnowledge Inscriber§r<BR>First place a §lKnowledge Core§r into the top-right slot. Next, use the crafting grid to setup the recipe for the item. If you have the required knowledge(research) for the recipe, the resulting item will be displayed. Pressing the save button will then inscribe the recipe onto the core. The finished product will then show in the stored-pattern area.<BR>To remove an inscribed recipe from the core, first select a pattern from the stored-pattern area.

tc.research_text.thaumicenergistics.TEARCANEASSEMBLER=Magical Molecule Assembly
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEARCANEASSEMBLER.1=While examining the §lMolecular Assembler§r it occurs to you that it may be possible to modify the assembler to produce arcane items. You conclude that by infusing the assembler with the appropriate shards it will be able to regulate vis flow into items. It will also need a moderate amount of vis storage, and the §lSilverwood Scepter§r seems the best choice.<BR>Note: The scepter is infused into the assembler, and must be fully charged.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEARCANEASSEMBLER.2=§lPattern Storage§r<BR>The assembler itself does not store crafting recipes. Further research may be required to devise a pattern storage medium.<BR>§lVis Replenishment§r<BR>Replenishing the assembler's internal vis storage will require the services of a §lVis Relay Interface§r.<BR>§lAcceleration Cards§r<BR>Each card decreases crafting time by 20% and increases power required by 50%.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEARCANEASSEMBLER.3=§lVis Discounts§r<BR>Due to the inclusion of the crafting scepter, the assembler has a base vis discount equal to that of the scepter. The discount can be further enhanced by providing the assembler vis discount armor. The discount for each aspect can be viewed by hovering over the aspect in the GUI.<BR>The assembler is not immune to the effects of warping gear; For each point of warp the assembler must draw an additional 15% power to remain stable while crafting.

tc.research_text.thaumicenergistics.TEESSVIBCMBR=Essentia Powered Network
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSVIBCMBR.1=Getting power for your network until this point has relied on burning items in the §lVibration Chamber§r. That is about to change!<BR>You have constructed a simple device that unleashes the energies of essentia to fuel the vibration chamber. By using distilled §lIgnis or Potentia§r essentia, you can generate more power than simply burning the item.<BR>Be aware that it has the same regulation behavior as the original chamber: It minimizes wasted power by slowing the reaction if the network is fully powered, but so long as there is essentia to use, it will use it.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSVIBCMBR.2=§l§nOperation§r<BR>By breaking down an item, such as coal, into Ignis or Potentia much more power can be generated from the essentia. Your early estimates show an increase of roughly 350% for processing coal essentia v.s. burning the coal directly. Potentia essentia seems to be much more potent than Ignis.<BR>The §lE.V.C.§r will rotate which essentia it is requesting on a regular interval when empty. When essentia is stored, it will only request more of the stored essentia.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEESSVIBCMBR.3=Opening the GUI shows how much and what type of essentia is stored. What is currently being processed, and the time remaining. As well as the current power production level.<LINE>§l§nNotes§r<BR>The §lE.V.C.§r can be placed in an §lEssentia Terminal§r to quickly fill or drain the stored essentia.<BR>The §lEssentia Export Bus§r, §lEssentia Provider§r, and essentia tubes can be used to keep the §lE.V.C.§r full.

thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEGOLEMWIFIBACKPACK.1=After watching your golems running around depositing gathered items into a chest for you to collect and store later, you wondered if you could cut out the middle-man.  Inspiration struck when you realized that you could utilize your networks wireless capabilities to do just that.<BR>After spending hours feverishly working, you created a backpack that will give your golems access to the network. The backpack does come with some limitations however. Golems must be in range of an §lAccess Point§r to communicate with the network. The fluix pearl atop the antenna serves as an indicator to whether or not the golem can communicate with the network.
thaumicenergistics.research_page.TEGOLEMWIFIBACKPACK.2=As communicating with the network takes power, you retro-fitted a charger to draw power from two embedded Nitor. When charged the backpack will be able to transmit for only a short time before starting another charge cycle. During this window of opportunity the golem will be able to interact with the network.<BR>To link the backpack with your network, place it in the security terminal.<LINE>As you progress with your golemancy research, check back here for potential new uses of the backpack.
