botanichorizons.BH_FLOWERS.body=Old documents speak of magical flowers, but these seem to be extinct in the wild. You did notice that the mushrooms you've seen in deep caves share a lot of the properties with these purported flowers. With the invention of alchemy you think you can recreate these flowers by steeping the spores of a mushroom in the essence of surface plants.
botanichorizons.BH_FLOWERDUPE.body=These flowers have proven very hard to grow in the wild, and don't take well to being broken. Fortunately your ventures into thaumaturgy have resulted in a new botanical recipe. Now you can split off a branch, dip it in this concoction, and it will create roots once more.
botanichorizons.BH_FLOWERCOLOUR.body=So far all your alchemical attempts have only yielded flowers of the parent species. This new method allows you to take the colour of something else and imprint it on the flower.
botanichorizons.BH_MUSHROOMS.body=Sometimes it's good to be backwards. You've revised your method for making flowers, and you are now able to turn them back into mushrooms.
botanichorizons.BH_ALTAR.body=Recent revelations in artificing have revealed how to infuse items into another. For added flavour you decided to take this approach a more "natural" way.
botanichorizons.BH_TERRASTEEL.body=Recent publications have shown the power of uranium. You decided you want to pump energy back into a metal and come up with something new. It even looks more radiant to the untrained eye, but you know it's merely a brighter shade of green.
botanichorizons.BH_ALFHEIM.body_0=Rumours speak of a dimension much further removed than the nether. Now that you have much higher energies to work with, it's time to try and build a portal. First we need a frame attuned to the energies involved in the process.
botanichorizons.BH_ALFHEIM.body_1=The second part is the controlling mechanism. It is very difficult to reliably open a dimensional portal, and some further tinkering is needed to put the mana sources and redirecting attributes in the exact spot to establish a stable link.
botanichorizons.BH_ALCHEMY_CATALYST.body=Alchemy with ingredients is nice, but you think you can do even better. You have designed a machine that can replace some ingredients with mana.
botanichorizons.BH_CONJURATION_CATALYST.body=You've managed to improve your earlier catalyst to replace all material resources with mana. The downside is that it can only create copies of simple materials.
botanichorizons.BH_MANA_PYLON.body=Using bookshelves to fuel your enchantment processes sounds oldfashioned to you. Instead you've discovered a way of passively infusing your enchantments by focusing aura through a mana-rich device. It also seems to work as an infusion stabiliser.
botanichorizons.BH_NATURA_PYLON.body=You needed something more powerful. This device can focus enough aura to pierce holes in the dimensional fabric. Only very small holes though.
botanichorizons.BH_GAIA_PYLON.body=Your aura-focusing research has reached the pinnacle of thaumaturgic knowledge. Other thaumaturges call you mad over the energies involved and tell you to stop or even flee the scene, but they just don't seem to understand. After all, tearing a big hole in the fabric of this world is EXACTLY what you want to do.
botanichorizons.BH_BREWERY.body=Your latest research has resulted in a breakthrough in potion making. You improved the process so that you have bigger yields with less impurities. You can even store the result in one bottle and take an occasional swig without the outside air ruining the brew's properties.
botanichorizons.BH_ALFGLASS_FLASK.body=This extradimensional glass turns out to be an excellent container for potions. Since the glass is already highly magical, this flask absorbs less from the potion itself, leaving more for you.
botanichorizons.BH_TERRASTEEL_SWORD.body=Terrasteel is a much more potent material than Thaumium, so you decided to upgrade your existing sword of the Zephyr with some.
botanichorizons.BH_TERRASTEEL_PICK.body=Terrasteel as its name implies has a high affinity with terrestrial materials. Your old pickaxe of the core seems like a good starting template.
botanichorizons.BH_TERRASTEEL_AXE.body=Your latest magimetallurgic invention has good affinity with natural substances. With some extra work you've now created a process to apply terrasteel to the Axe of the Stream.
botanichorizons.BH_LAPUTA.body_0=Sometimes you have to show off. You found a way to infuse a patch of land and make it float in the sky. It seems to be pretty difficult though. The shard of laputa works as a temporary vessel to house the energies required, before it's pushed into the ground.
botanichorizons.BH_LAPUTA.body_1=Since the amount of energy needed increases per area of land you want to float, you have quickly realised that you need better and better materials to do the job. The return on investment also doesn't appear to be that good.
botanichorizons.BH_VIRUS.body=You've ventured into an odd corner of carnivorous plants and created something nastier. At least animal test subjects seem not to be a moral issue for you.
