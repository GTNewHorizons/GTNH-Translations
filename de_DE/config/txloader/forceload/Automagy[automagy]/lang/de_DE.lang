Automagy.research_name.SLIVERS=Slivers of Magic
Automagy.research_text.SLIVERS=Fragments of Fragments
Automagy.research_page.SLIVERS.1=You've developed a process to break down the various shards of primal magic into even smaller pieces. This is helpful when using a whole shard (if shards can be described as being "whole") would be unnecessary and even wasteful for the task at hand.<BR>Unfortunately, putting the pieces back together isn't quite as easy. It will take significantly more vis to produce a shard than break one down.

Automagy.research_name.REDSTONETHEORY=Redstone Theory
Automagy.research_text.REDSTONETHEORY=Magic or technology?
Automagy.research_page.REDSTONETHEORY.1=Redstone possesses many unusual characteristics. Its ability to transmit signals and form "circuits" has led many to believe it is a form of mundane technology. Indeed, redstone powder is the foundation upon which all sorts of technology relies. However, one who is versed in the arcane arts knows that redstone's unique properties are invaluable to all manner of magics, potions perhaps being the most well-known example.<BR>For these reasons, redstone is often viewed as a natural bridge between magic and technology. And so it is, but the thaumaturge knows that it is much more: At the fundamental level, redstone is no mundane material at
Automagy.research_page.REDSTONETHEORY.2=all. Even when functioning as part of an elaborate circuit or mechanical device, a more careful look reveals that its behavior can be described only as magical.<BR>You aim to take full advantage of this wondrous substance. To this end, you have designed some simple devices to help you better incorporate "redstone logic" into your everyday thaumaturgy.<BR>You are certain that further studies will yield greater and more diverse inventions. In fact, this may even be the basis of a whole new discipline of thaumaturgy, one focused on allowing a thaumaturge to automate tasks more intelligently. You think you'll call it §5Automagy§0.
Automagy.research_page.REDSTONETHEORY.3=§l  §nRedstone Inversion Torch§r<BR>The redstone torch's ability to invert a redstone signal is very useful but you cannot help but notice that it inverts only in a binary manner. Even the weakest signal that reaches the block the torch is attached to will cause it to turn off, and when it is on, it is always at full strength. But what if you wanted a truly inverted signal? Not just from 15 to 0, but from 10 to 5, from 3 to 12, and so on?<BR>Utilizing basic thaumaturgical principles, you have created a more orderly, less all-or-nothing redstone torch.
Automagy.research_page.REDSTONETHEORY.4=§l         §nHourglass§r<BR>The redstone hourglass is a simple but versatile device allowing you to regulate the timings of redstone signal transmissions.<BR>When activated (by right-click or redstone signal), the glass turns and sand starts to fall. A redstone pulse is emitted once the sand has settled. If the rear of a redstone comparator is next to the hourglass, it will output a signal which increases in strength as the sand falls.<BR>The hourglass outputs to its left and right sides. It accepts activation signals from any other side.<BR>Right-click the hourglass with your wand or a stick to adjust the timer's
Automagy.research_page.REDSTONETHEORY.5=length. The timer is quite precise but unfortunately only allows adjustments in five-second increments and peaks out at 60 seconds, but you know this device is only the foundation upon which you will build better things.

Automagy.research_name.MAGICHOURGLASS=Magic Hourglass
Automagy.research_text.MAGICHOURGLASS=Mystical timekeeping
Automagy.research_page.MAGICHOURGLASS.1=The hourglass you designed is useful for delaying signals and producing redstone pulses but is lacking in some areas. Repetition, for one. Also, sometimes you want the timer to start from zero each time the hourglass is activated even if sand was already falling but this is impossible with mundane sand which must flow from where it left off.<BR>To address these flaws, you've enchanted an hourglass with the ability to turn itself over repeatedly and the ability to instantly move its sand to the top (restarting the timer). If you so choose, it can instead move the sand to the bottom, ending the timer early without emitting a signal from the
Automagy.research_page.MAGICHOURGLASS.2=hourglass (and stopping the loop if it was set to repeat).<BR>Additionally, there are several different signal modes. §lPulse§r mode is as standard. §lConstant§r mode means a signal is sent the entire time sand is falling. §lAlternating§r mode is the same except it is sent only 50% of the time. §lNegative Pulse§r mode works as Constant mode except there is a brief period where no signal is sent when the glass turns itself over (if set to repeat). §lDisabled§r means no signal is sent at all.<BR>The hourglass's reaction to receiving a signal (on any side but its left and right) can also be changed. By default, the hourglass flips each time it receives a new signal.
Automagy.research_page.MAGICHOURGLASS.3=Another option is to have it only run when it is receiving a signal or only run when it isn't. Or it can ignore redstone signals altogether.<BR>Finally, you can fine-tune the timer far better than before and its maximum length far exceeds that of the redstone hourglass. However, you will need to use your wand to do so (by right-click); this is no mere mechanical contraption adjustable by poking a stick into a hole and turning it.

Automagy.research_name.REDCRYSTAL=Redcrystal
Automagy.research_text.REDCRYSTAL=Definitely magic.
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL.1=You've discovered that some materials, once crystallized a certain way, become more susceptible to magical control. The new crystalline structures can then be rearranged and, in some cases, instructions can be imprinted upon them.<BR>This discovery came to you during your experimentations on redstone powder. The resulting redstone crystal - or §lredcrystal§r - can be oriented more easily in a chosen direction. It can be placed on any side of a block. Right-click on a section of redcrystal with your wand to add or remove a connection to its neighbors.
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL.2=In addition to passing its signal to other redcrystal in adjacent blocks, it will also pass a signal around corners when the two redcrystal clusters aren't directly touching so long as both of them are attached to the same block and there is empty space in the adjoining area.<IMG>automagy:textures/gui/redcrystal-corner.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>

Automagy.research_name.REDCRYSTAL_AMP=Amplified Redcrystal
Automagy.research_text.REDCRYSTAL_AMP=Stay strong
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_AMP.1=When this type of redcrystal receives a redstone signal, it outputs a full-strength signal in the specified direction. If other redcrystal is used to pass the signal along, then its effective strength will remain 15 for many more blocks before it decays to 14 strength, at which point it will fall by one each tile as is normal for redstone signals.<BR>Dim redcrystal is an exception to this rule as it will reduce the signal strength to 14 or below immediately.<BR>Amplified redcrystal will only receive a signal from the side opposite to its output.

Automagy.research_name.REDCRYSTAL_DIM=Dim Redcrystal
Automagy.research_text.REDCRYSTAL_DIM=Less is more
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_DIM.1=This variety of redcrystal allows you to cap the signal strength it emits to a specified value. This can be useful when devices react differently to specific signal strengths, for example. It can still output a strength lower than the cap so there are some situations where you may want to pair it with something else, such as amplified redcrystal or a redstone torch.<BR>To change its cap, right-click the center of a dim redcrystal with your wand.

Automagy.research_name.REDCRYSTAL_DENSE=Dense Redcrystal
Automagy.research_text.REDCRYSTAL_DENSE=Cull the weak
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_DENSE.1=The structure of dense redcrystal is such that weaker redstone signals cannot penetrate it, preventing the signal from being passed on. Fortunately for you, its structure is magical and can be altered at your whim. In effect, dense redcrystal will always output either a signal at least equal to the strength you specify or no signal at all.<BR>To change its minimum required strength, right-click the center of a dense redcrystal with your wand.

Automagy.research_name.REDCRYSTAL_RES=Resonating Redcrystal
Automagy.research_text.REDCRYSTAL_RES=No strings attached
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_RES.1=When you created the first varieties of redcrystal, you experimented with each primal aspect. When it came to Aer, the resulting crystal and its unique vibrational energies were interesting but the energy was too weak to have any practical applications. With some additional research, however, you now have a way to focus that energy in a specific direction, allowing it to be received some distance away.<BR>Resonating redcrystal transmits redstone signals through the air and objects alike in a straight line until it is picked up by other resonating redcrystal. The two crystals must be oriented to face each other (so if one is attached to the bottom of a
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_RES.2=block, the other must be below it and attached to the top of a block).<BR>This signal can travel up to 15 blocks. Its strength is preserved just as if the crystals were next to each other.

Automagy.research_name.REDCRYSTAL_MIRRORBOUND=Mercurial Redcrystal
Automagy.research_text.REDCRYSTAL_MIRRORBOUND=Thaumaturge's Heliograph
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_MIRRORBOUND.1=Now that you are able to tap into the strange realm found through magic mirrors to create far-flung networks of production and transport, you need a way to intelligently control their disparate elements. Why waste resources creating and sending items through mirrors that are just going to pile up on a full chest and decay?<BR>By adapting a resonating crystal to the seemingly-erratic oscillations of the void between worlds, the resulting mercurial redcrystal can send its signal through a linked mirror in the vicinity to be picked up by another mercurial redcrystal on the other side.
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_MIRRORBOUND.2=In order to send or receive a signal, the device must be linked to a mirror. Do this by holding it in your hand and right-clicking on the mirror. It must then be placed within eight blocks of that location. Of course, you'll need to link another redcrystal to the corresponding mirror on the other end.
Automagy.research_page.REDCRYSTAL_MIRRORBOUND.MIRRORESSENTIA=§l      §nEssentia Mirror§r<BR>Mercurial redcrystal can be linked to an essentia mirror instead of a standard magic mirror. This would probably be the more efficient option unless magic mirrors are going to be in use anyway.

Automagy.research_name.GREEDYCHEST=Greedy Chest
Automagy.research_text.GREEDYCHEST=Greed is good
Automagy.research_page.GREEDYCHEST.1=You have sometimes wondered whether the nature of the hungry chest was actually tied to true gluttony or if you were merely anthropomorphizing a simple, largely-immobile automaton. There's just something about the sound it makes when it gobbles things up....<BR>You have been unable to detect any cognitive ability in the things but your studies have nonetheless led you to methods by which other "needs" could be imbued upon such objects. It was a small jump to go from a basic hunger to primitive greed, though harnessing this into something useful to you required the invention of some special components.
Automagy.research_page.GREEDYCHEST.2=The greedy chest steals items as they are placed in adjacent inventories. In effect, 50% of everything put into its neighbors ends up inside the greedy chest instead, provided the items will fit. If you right-click it with your wand, you can change this behavior so it takes more or less, attempts to maintain a stock, or takes only items that surpass a given threshold. You can also choose which neighbors it will steal from.<BR>The chest will not take from hoppers below it, nor can it steal from another greedy chest that is set to take from its location.<BR>You are working on a way to make the chest covet only specific things (a filtering mechanism of sorts) but
Automagy.research_page.GREEDYCHEST.3=this should be a good start.<BR>In the meantime, the other properties of this §lpearl§r you discovered seem interesting. A normal ender pearl teleports you when thrown, but this one is more keyed in to nearby items. Perhaps you should take it out for a spin. §oYou might even learn something.§r
Automagy.research_page.GREEDYCHEST.ENCHANTEDPAPER=§l      §nEnchanted Paper§r<BR>With the use of runic whitelists and blacklists, you can change what the chest covets and to what degree, letting you control which items it will grab.

Automagy.research_name.ENCHANTEDPAPER=Enchanted Paper
Automagy.research_text.ENCHANTEDPAPER=The letter of the law
Automagy.research_page.ENCHANTEDPAPER.1=There are times when written instructions simply don't carry the weight you desire... especially when what you desire is the weight of magical force.<BR>By infusing ordinary paper with vis and preparing a pliable inlay of golden runes, you are now able to produce enchanted paper that can help enforce your will upon your creations.<BR>A common use of enchanted paper is to create whitelists and blacklists which can be used to dictate what is "seen" by thaumic devices such as the greedy chest.
Automagy.research_page.ENCHANTEDPAPER.2=You can turn a whitelist into a blacklist or vice versa while preserving the filtering options you have already written on the list.<BR>You can also copy the filtering options from one list to another (of either type) by simply placing both of them on an arcane worktable. The contents of the first are copied to the second (and the first is not consumed in the process, of course).
Automagy.research_page.ENCHANTEDPAPER.3=§l        §nEnchanting§r<BR>Enchanted paper can also be bound into book form. Bookshelves created with these are four times as potent as a standard bookshelf when it comes to boosting an enchantment table, so only four (instead of 15) are required for the table to provide level 30 enchantments.

Automagy.research_name.THIRSTYTANK=Thirsty Tank
Automagy.research_text.THIRSTYTANK=Unquenchable
Automagy.research_page.THIRSTYTANK.1=With a few modifications, the magical hunger that drives the hungry chest becomes a thirst that causes a specially constructed tank to "drink" liquids that come into contact with it.<BR>Only fluid blocks that can be picked up by a bucket can be swallowed, but even flowing liquid can cause a reaction. The tank can take fluids from the world at some distance provided there is an unbroken chain of the same type leading from the tank to the target block. In this way, small pools can be consumed without moving the tank.<BR>Liquids can also be added or removed from the tank in the
Automagy.research_page.THIRSTYTANK.2=standard fashion, such as by buckets or certain golems.<BR>If placed next to a water source block, the tank can draw water from it indefinitely.<BR>You can also fill and empty water bottles using the tank if it contains water.<BR>You might want to shelter it from the rain, though.

Automagy.research_name.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH=Thirsty Glyphs
Automagy.research_text.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH=Watermarks
Automagy.research_page.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH.1=The thirsty tank could do so much more with liquid than gather and store a few buckets' worth. To unlock its potential, you have devised a system of glyphs and a special Aqua-imbued inky paste to go with it. When this "aqueous admixture" is formed into the right shape alongside objects with appropriate properties, it can be magically impressed upon a slate, becoming a portable glyph that can be applied to the side of a thirsty tank.<BR>A thirsty tank can have up to six glyphs, one on each of its sides. The side chosen is important in some cases since certain glyphs' effects are "aimed" in that direction.
Automagy.research_page.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH.2=To remove a glyph, simply right-click the side it was placed upon while sneaking with a wand.<BR>The glyphs you've designed so far and their effects are as follows:<BR>§lVoid:§r The tank will accept more liquid than it can hold. The excess is destroyed.<BR>§lConsumption:§r The tank will, over time, truly consume (destroy) any liquid it stores. Use additional glyphs for faster consumption.<BR>§lSiphoning:§r Liquid will be siphoned out of the tank into another container in the direction specified.<BR>§lEnvy:§r The tank will take liquid from the container in the direction
Automagy.research_page.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH.3=specified, one bucket's worth at a time.<BR>§lTemperance:§r The tank will not pull liquid into itself unless it is receiving a redstone signal.<BR>§lPreservation:§r The tank will prevent itself from being drained entirely. You could use this to ensure a tank will only ever contain a specific fluid.<BR>§lGuzzler:§r The tank draws liquid into itself faster. More glyphs improve its speed further.<BR>§lReservoir:§r The tank's capacity is increased by 16 buckets' worth for each of these glyphs.

Automagy.research_name.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH_BOVINE=Glyph of the Bovine
Automagy.research_text.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH_BOVINE=No Bull
Automagy.research_page.THIRSTYTANK_GLYPH_BOVINE.1=Your advancements in the magic of detecting creatures have allowed the creation of an additional type of glyph: The glyph of the bovine. A thirsty tank with this glyph applied will no longer drink liquid flowing near it. Instead, it will look in the direction to which the glyph was applied for cows to milk.<BR>While the speed at which the tank searches for cows to be milked is increased by a §lglyph of the guzzler§r, the real limiting factor is that once a cow has been milked, thirsty tanks cannot milk it again for some time.
# No, seriously. There are no bulls. What's up with that?

Automagy.research_name.AVARICIOUS=Structured Avarice
Automagy.research_text.AVARICIOUS=For Fun and Profit
Automagy.research_page.AVARICIOUS.1=After experimenting with the Avarice Pearl, you have made two important observations. First, the pearl has the uncanny ability to attract nearby items toward itself and to the person (or machine) that throws it. Second, when used outside the confines of a properly-calibrated thaumic device, it is unstable. The more items and the more distinct stacks of items it moves, the more likely it will harm its user or break into pieces.<BR>After some study, you have discovered a way to strengthen the pearl. On the other hand, you know that even these shattered fragments have potential uses and so you've devised a more efficient means of acquiring them.
Automagy.research_page.AVARICIOUS.2=One interesting property of the shattered avarice pearl is that endermen seem to be slightly more common when you've got one on you. Perhaps they are subconsciously drawn into the vicinity by the lingering End-Magic that is now exposed to the air.
Automagy.research_page.AVARICIOUS.3=§l       §nMiser's Pearl§r<BR>The Miser's Pearl is a much more sensible way of picking up loose items than the Avarice Pearl. Not only will it never shatter from picking up "too much" or inflict damage, but it will move items to you as it flies.<BR>There are a couple of downsides to note. The first is that it won't move more than ten stacks per throw, but this limitation is well worth the savings in ender pearls and other valuable materials.<BR>Secondly, the pearl consumes a small amount of §8Ordo§0 vis when manually thrown. You'll need to carry something to provide this - but you've got a wand on you all the time anyway, right?

Automagy.research_name.EAGERCHEST=Eager Chest
Automagy.research_text.EAGERCHEST=A chest that doesn't wait to be filled
Automagy.research_page.EAGERCHEST.1=You've managed to create a variation upon the greedy chest that focuses its attention on the person opening it instead of its neighbors. By tempering the pearl used in its construction, the Eager Chest is imbued with the desire to "trade" rather than steal. It is still rather impatient about this and so will immediately attempt to give and take items when opened.<BR>You've intentionally left some holes in its senses, allowing you to §lsneak§r up to it when you want to look inside without triggering a trade. Additionally, the chest won't trade with people it doesn't recognize, which at first would be anyone but the person who placed it,
Automagy.research_page.EAGERCHEST.2=but others can introduce themselves by use of a wand.<BR>A wand is also necessary in order to tell the chest what should be considered a proper trade. By default, a certain level of greed slips through, as it will take anything it senses is valuable while giving only things it doesn't value - although in truth, that is how it works even with runic whitelists or blacklists installed. The difference is only that those lists skew its evaluations.<LINE>On another note, you suspect that this amalgam you've concocted will be valued highly by pechs.

Automagy.research_name.TENACIOUSCHEST=Tenacious Chest
Automagy.research_text.TENACIOUSCHEST=A chest that won't let go
Automagy.research_page.TENACIOUSCHEST.1=Now that you've mastered imbuing chests with greed, creating a simple new variant was a straightforward task.<BR>The tenacious chest values its contents, as you'd imagine any chest might, but this one has the ability to prevent items from being entirely taken away. You can still reach in and take out whatever you like, but golems, hoppers, and most other automation methods will be unable to remove §lthe last stack§r of any given item.<BR>The chest will attempt to separate one item of each type into their own stacks. It might feel it can hold onto them better this way, but the true
Automagy.research_page.TENACIOUSCHEST.2=purpose for this behavior is to allow automation to have access to as many items as possible while still leaving one behind.

Automagy.research_name.ENDERDISJUNCTION=Ender Disjunction

Automagy.research_page.ENDERDISJUNCTION.1=Your efforts to exploit the tie between avarice pearls and the enderman menace have finally paid off. You've crafted a ring that, when worn, hooks itself onto the invisible transdimensional threads generated by ender creatures. Each teleport occurring nearby (whether arriving or leaving) results in a sudden and violent tearing away of these hooks, seriously injuring the creature.<BR>A source of §8Perditio§0 in your inventory (such as a wand) is required for the ring to function.

Automagy.research_text.REMOTECOMPARATOR=Keeping an eye on things
Automagy.research_page.REMOTECOMPARATOR.1=Signals that relay how full your chests are can be useful but redstone comparators can often get in the way. With this in mind, you have invented the remote comparator. It outputs a signal based on a block's inventory (or other status) just like a redstone comparator but doesn't have to be next to the block. There are even some containers and item-holders a normal comparator doesn't work on which this will handle, including many related to thaumaturgy.<BR>Of course, some other way of telling the device where it should be looking is necessary. Fortunately, the crystallization technique you discovered can help in this regard.
Automagy.research_page.REMOTECOMPARATOR.2=§l      §nCrystalline Eye§r<BR>A crystalline eye is used to allow certain thaumic devices to observe other locations. An eye can be attuned to a specific position by right-clicking with it on the desired block. Then, simply place the attuned eye into the slot provided by the device.<BR>There is a limit to how far away the device can be from the specified coordinates. This limit is generally twenty blocks but it is possible that some devices will have other requirements.

Automagy.research_name.VISREADER=Vis Reader
Automagy.research_text.VISREADER=A watched crucible never boils
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.1=Measuring the empty space inside a container is one thing, but determining the type and amount of vis is another story. And the protaganist of this story? That'd be the vis reader.<BR>The vis reader outputs a redstone signal based on the vis contents of anything from warded jars to crucibles to aura nodes themselves. It could even read wands' vis if they were held on a suitable device.<BR>There are two ways this can work. The simplest method is placing the vis reader directly beneath the object to be read. Otherwise, place a remote comparator above the reader and link its crystalline eye to the
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.2=target location. The comparator will cease its normal functions, instead relaying vis information to the reader to act upon.<BR>Right-click the vis reader with your wand to configure it.<BR>§l§nConfiguration§r<BR>The signal strength output by the vis reader varies depending on its configuration and the aspects detected. Signal strength normally operates on a principle similar to an inventory-checking comparator: 15 when the container is at capacity, 0 when empty, and something in-between otherwise. You can filter by aspect type by placing §ljar labels§r inside.<BR>§lInverse Mode:§r A full-strength
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.3=signal is sent when empty and no signal when full, with states in-between adjusted accordingly.<BR>§lTotal Mode:§r The count of all aspects are totalled together to compare against the capacity.<BR>§lAny (High) Mode:§r The highest count of any one aspect is used for the value that will be compared against the capacity. (But see the §lNodes§r section.)<BR>§lAny (Low) Mode:§r As Any (High) mode but the lowest count of any one aspect is used. (Also see the §lNodes§r section.)<BR>§lCapacity:§r The value that will be considered "full" for signal strength calculations. If set to §lAuto§r, the vis
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.4=reader will automatically determine the capacity based on the object it is viewing (if possible).<BR>§lAspect Count Mode:§r This mode differs from the others. Rather than testing how "full" of vis the target is, a signal is output based on the number of aspects present (even those with a value of zero). A strength of more than 15 can be output unless in Invert mode, but redcrystal is required to read such a signal. The Capacity setting and jar labels are ignored.
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.5=§l           §nNodes§r<BR>When the read object is a node, Capacity is set to §lAuto§r, and one of the §lAny§r modes is selected, then the capacity will be the detected maximum of a single specific aspect rather than all aspects' maximums combined. The specific aspect chosen for comparison is that which is most or least filled compared to its own capacity rather than whichever aspect simply has the highest or lowest count at the moment.<BR>(So if the mode is §lAny (High)§r, then an aspect that is 50% full, at 5 out of 10 vis, will be preferred over one that is 25% full, at 10 out of 40, even though the latter has more vis.)
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.INFUSION=§l          §nInfusion§r<BR>You've found that not only can the vis reader measure the presence of aspects in an object but it can evaluate the lack of aspects when certain devices are attempting to carry out their tasks. At least, this seems to be the case with the matrix of an infusion altar.<BR>This could be useful if you want to send redstone signals based on whether an infusion is taking place and how it is going.
Automagy.research_page.VISREADER.ESSENTIALOCUS=§l       §nEssentia Locus§r<BR>With the aid of the Essentia Locus, a vis reader can react to the combined essentia totals of many jars at once. Either place the reader beneath the water of the structure or use a remote comparator with a crystalline eye attuned to the locus block itself.<BR>The vis reader treats the locus similarly to how it treats an aura node. It calculates a given type of essentia's maximum value based on the capacity of the jars that either currently contain that aspect or are labeled for it.

Automagy.research_page.TALLYBLOCK.1=Knowing how full a chest is is all well and good, but often what you really want to keep track of is how many of a given thing you've got in there. To that end, you've designed the Tally Box.<BR>Simply place it such that it points at a container (similar to placing a hopper). Next, fill out a runic whitelist or blacklist and place it inside the box. It will emit a redstone signal when the conditions you specify are met. The signal is output in the direction opposite from the target container.<BR>Alternatively, place a §lremote comparator§r above the box, attune a crystalline eye to the inventory
Automagy.research_page.TALLYBLOCK.2=you want to examine, then place that eye into the comparator. The comparator will cease its normal functions, instead relaying item information for the tally box to act upon.<BR>If a tally box is set to read from another tally box, contents will be retrieved from the second box's target. If that target is also a tally box, then it will relay its own target's contents, and so on. By chaining tally boxes and remote comparators together in this way, containers may be read from very long distances.

Any item that touches or passes close enough to a hungry maw will be placed into the inventory associated with the side of the block to which the maw is attached.<BR>To begin, an obsidian block must be placed above a hungry chest. Up to three additional obsidian blocks may be placed next to the chest (but there is no benefit to having one below it). Finally, right-click on the block above the chest using a wand that has the portable hole focus equipped.

The mirror can hold two lists at a time.<BR>Only items specified by a list will be taken automatically, even in the case of blacklists. A blacklist will need to have quantities specified to be of any use; in this way, you could tell the mirror to leave a certain amount of the item in your inventory

The more there are, the stronger the signal. (Redcrystal is required to receive a signal strength over 15.)<BR>You can limit the count to include only adult animals, or only children, when applicable.
Automagy.research_page.ENTITYSIGNAL.2=The area examined by the device is determined by the blocks around it. Placing a block on one face will limit detection in that direction but boost detection in the opposite direction. Blocks on opposite faces (e.g. north and south) will prevent detection in both directions. However, glass and replaceable blocks like water are ignored, allowing scanning in their direction.<BR>If, for example, all sides are open, then the device will be in the center of the area. If the only open sides are its top, north, and east, then the device will be in the bottom-south-western corner of the area. (In both examples, the area would be 11x11x11 blocks, which is the maximum possible size.)

Now, you have found a better way.<BR>By combining your knowledge of the thaumostatic field and energized nodes, you can use this field to transmit Potentia through the air. Establishing and maintaining the link between a Potentia source and its destination is mentally taxing but a crystalline brain fortified by Aer is well suited to the task.<BR>The §lThaumostatic Spire§r which enables this has several requirements which must be met to
Automagy.research_page.THAUMOSTATICREFUELER.2=construct it and to keep it functioning.<BR>The first step is to create two §lThaumostatic Pylon§r blocks and a §lThaumostatic Controller§r. A chiseled quartz block and a block of thaumium are also required.<BR>Next, the components must be placed in a suitable location. The chiseled quartz block goes on the bottom and the thaumium block should be on top, with the pylons and controller placed in any order between them (with no gaps). The thaumium block must have empty space above it and an unobstructed view upward to the open sky. Once everything is in place, right-click on the controller with your wand.
Automagy.research_page.THAUMOSTATICREFUELER.3=The Spire can cover a wide horizontal area and has no vertical limit. Any equipped thaumostatic harness in the area which contains a warded jar will have a steady supply of Potentia provided to it so long as the Spire has any to give and it is powered by §6Aer§0 vis from a relay. Use essentia tubes to connect the §lcontroller§r to the Potentia source.<LINE>The covered area can be increased by feeding the controller a steady supply of Aer essentia. The rate at which Potentia is distributed to harnesses in the area can be increased by piping in Volatus. Both are amplified through the placement of additional pylon blocks in the structure. (No benefit is gained after

At its heart - or rather, its nerve center - is the Essentia Locus.<BR>The potential of this system is high but its beginnings may seem relatively humble. The locus will simply examine the contents of warded jars and relay the combined total. Still, this is most convenient as a vis reader could use it to react to the essentia total of all your jars, not just one.<BR>Once the key component of the locus is crafted, it must be placed above a water crystal cluster that is above
Automagy.research_page.ESSENTIALOCUS.2=a block of lapis lazuli. The lapis should be encircled by water and the water should be contained on the sides by silverwood planks.<BR>The Essentia Locus block must be placed last.<BR>Once the locus is established, specify warded jars using crystalline eyes. A single eye can point to multiple jars: Any jars adjacent to the first's location and all similarly connected jars will be considered. Right-click on the locus with an attuned eye to put it to use. Right-click with an empty hand to remove a crystalline eye.<BR>Normally, a maximum of twelve jars can be examined and only one crystalline eye can be used. Placing
Automagy.research_page.ESSENTIALOCUS.3=water crystal clusters adjacent to the silverwood planks of the construct increases this by eight jars and one eye per cluster. Each cluster also increases the maximum distance a group of jars can be from the locus.<BR>Note that while a vis reader cannot be placed directly beneath the essentia locus block itself, one placed under any of the structure's water blocks will function and additional readers can be set up using remote comparators.
Automagy.research_page.ESSENTIALOCUS.ESSENTIARESERVOIR=§l     §nEssentia Reservoir§r<BR>You have found that the Essentia Locus is capable of obtaining essentia totals from an essentia reservoir similar to how it does so from warded jars.

Automagy.research_text.INVENTARIUM=For the hoard
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM.1=The more stuff you have, the more difficult it is to keep track of. The tally box is of limited use when what it's looking for could be found in one of several different chests, or worse, its numbers spread across multiple chests. What you'd need is a centralized storage-tracking system. From this need springs the Inventarium.<BR>To function, the core of the Inventarium must be placed above an order crystal cluster that is itself above a block of amber or amber bricks. Bookshelves arranged as indicated on the following pages are also required.<BR>The core must be placed last.
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM.2=The Inventarium itself doesn't contain any items but many containers can be associated with it and their contents displayed. A §ltally box§r that points at the Inventarium Core (indirectly, by way of a remote comparator) or that directly points at any of the eight bookshelves in this diagram will output a redstone signal based on the combined total contents of all associated containers.<LINE>To tie your containers to the Inventarium, you will need to employ at least one §lUnseen Scribe§r. This enchanted device records the contents of certain objects around it and passes this information on to the Inventarium proper. It will only examine a single type of container.
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM.3=The first inventory found behind the device sets this type. Containers to be included must be within a 7x7x7 area centered on the scribe.<BR>To operate, an Unseen Scribe must be linked to the local Inventarium and be provided with a steady supply of §8Ordo§0 vis (by vis relay).<BR>Right-click on a scribe to review the items it has recorded or §lall§r items in the system.<LINE>The maximum number of Unseen Scribes allowed per Inventarium Core starts at one. Each order crystal cluster placed in a 7x7x7 area centered on the core increases this by one. Each cluster also increases
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM.4=the distance which a scribe can be from the core.<BR>Each bookshelf in the area contributes 81 slots to the maximum number of inventory slots that the Inventarium can cover. (That's 3 standard chests per bookshelf.) This includes the 8 bookshelves in the diagram as well as any others within 3 blocks of the core. Containers will not be partially included: If its slot count is higher than what is available, the Scribe won't relay any of its contents. (Black particles will appear above the scribe if a container is excluded for this reason.)<BR>To link an Unseen Scribe to the Inventarium Core, simply right-click on the scribe with your wand. The
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM.5=core must be within 10 blocks (with 8 additional blocks allowed per order cluster).<BR>If the scribe is in range of multiple cores, it will normally be linked to the closest one. To link it to a different core, you should first mark that core as preferred by right-clicking on it with your wand.<BR>Right-clicking a core with your wand will also give you numbers for the Inventarium's currently used and maximum slots and scribes.

Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.1=To properly consolidate your storage, you'll need not just a list but also a way to retrieve what you've stored. And what better way to accomplish this than with golems?<BR>Several components are required to get your delivery system working as intended. At a minimum, you'll need a functional Inventarium (including at least one Unseen Scribe reading from containers), a golem with access to your storage containers, a suitable drop-off point for the golem to put the items it retrieves, a way to place orders, and a way to turn these orders into something the golem will follow. To fulfill these last two requirements, you've invented some new devices.
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.2=Multiple drop-off points may be used, each with one or more §lFill§r core- fitted golems using it as their home location. A drop-off point can be any location where your golem(s) can leave items but, if it is a container, it §lmust be quickly emptied§r of items or deliveries may be hampered. Consider having them drop items into a magic mirror (rather than a chest), linking the mirror to another that will get the items directly to where you'll stand when placing orders.<BR>Every container read by your scribes should have at least one of these fill golems linked to it (by golemancer's bell) and no such golem should be told to take from other containers. Unexpected results may occur otherwise. Keeping containers sorted such that a given item type
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.3=is found in as few containers as possible may speed larger deliveries since fewer trips will be needed.<BR>Next, position a §lGolemic Taskmaster§r nearby and link the Fill golems to it using a §lGolem Linking Bell§r. A single taskmaster can handle up to six golems. The golems need not be tied to the same drop-off point but the taskmaster can only control them if their resting location (where they stand when not moving items) is within five blocks.<BR>As with the scribe, each taskmaster must be linked to the Inventarium Core (right-click with a wand) and the distance over which this is allowed is increased by order crystal clusters near the core.
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.4=A §lMemory Block§r must be installed for each taskmaster, so - since each Requisition Tome also needs one (next page) - you'll need at least two.<BR>To be of use, a Memory Block must be placed within the 7x2x7 area that starts two blocks below the core and it must be next to an amber block or amber bricks (such as the one directly below the core). Right- clicking the core with your wand will display the number of currently used and maximum memory slots.<LINE>
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.5=The last piece of the puzzle is the §lRequisition Tome§r. Like the Unseen Scribe, it will display the entire contents of your storage system. This is where you place orders.<BR>Left-click on a listed item to increase the number ordered or right-click to decrease it. Hold Shift to move stacks or Ctrl to move 10 at a time. Use the slots on the left or hold Alt/Option to request more than you actually have stored.<BR>Using the "Mirrors" button in the GUI and a crystalline eye pointed at a nearby mirror, the tome can become a convenient place to drop items off as well.<BR>The tome has requirements similar to
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.6=those of a taskmaster: A dedicated Memory Block, linking it to the core, and order crystal clusters to increase the linking distance. In addition, the tome requires a supply of §8Ordo§0 vis (by vis relay).<BR>Pointing a §ltally box§r at a Requisition Tome will cause the box to output a redstone signal based on the currently requested items.<BR>One final note: Golems aren't the best at adapting to changing orders, so if you reduce the amount requested after they've already picked too much up, they'll simply drop the excess on the floor. It may be wise to have something in place to put such items back into their containers.
Automagy.research_page.INVENTARIUM_DELIVERY.MIRRORINPUT=§l       §nMelding Mirror§r<BR>By way of the "Mirrors" button in the GUI and a crystalline eye, a melding mirror may be used for item input instead of a standard magic mirror.

To this end, you have created §lruned obsidian§r. In addition to being used to encase the Nethermind itself, such runes must surround it in the indicated fashion (next page).<BR>There are different runes for different purposes. Any basic runed obsidian block shown in the diagram can be replaced by a more specialized rune. The more runes of a given type there are, the more of an impact that type will have (to a point). With only basic runes, the device will operate fairly slowly and will generate only netherrack and the occasional patch of lava.
Automagy.research_page.NETHERMIND.3=Once the runes are arranged, tap the Nethermind block with your wand. You can tap it again to turn the device off, but it costs vis from your wand every time it is started.<BR>To function, the Nethermind must be powered by §cIgnis§0 vis supplied by a relay. It also needs warded jars nearby from which it can pull essentia. The type and quantity of essentia needed is determined by the runes at work. Basic runed obsidian requires only Ignis and Terra.<BR>Blocks conjured from Netherstuff will appear in a 9x9x9 area two blocks below the structure.
Automagy.research_page.NETHERMIND.4=§l    §nRuned Obsidian (Rock)§r<BR>Use this rune to increase the chance that netherrack will be generated. If at least four block-specifying runes like this are in place, then only the blocks they specify will be generated. The more runes tied to a given block, the more likely that block will be created. (So if four of a single type are used, then the chance is 100%%.)<BR>Another advantage of using this rune is that generating netherrack with it requires less essentia than doing so using basic runes. (Placing additional Rock runes does not further decrease the cost.)<BR>Cost per conjuration: %s.
Automagy.research_page.NETHERMIND.5=§l    §nRuned Obsidian (Sea)§r<BR>Use this rune to increase the chance that lava will be generated. As with other block-specifying runes, having at least four of them means only the specified blocks will be generated.<BR>Cost per conjuration: %s.

Automagy.research_page.GOLEMWORKBENCH.1=The golem's workbench allows you to lay out a pattern and crafting instructions with enough magical aid that even a golem could follow them.<BR>Still, many recipes are too complicated for the typical golem, so the recipe must fit in a 2x2 grid or all of its components must be the same. (Perhaps more advanced golems won't be so limited.)<BR>Once the recipe is specified using the first nine slots, provide the materials to be used in the bottom slots. Then, place a golem with the §lEmpty§r golem animation core so it is attached to the workbench and instruct the golem to only take the item you want it to craft. Use the

Multiple upgrades of the same type will stack (except Entropy).<BR>To remove an upgrade, right-click the side it was placed upon while sneaking with a wand.<BR>§lAir:§r The golem can apply its Speed to the crafting process. The faster the golem, the faster it will craft. However, golems using this upgrade
Automagy.research_page.GOLEMWORKBENCH_UPGRADE.2=are more prone to lethargy than normal, meaning more §8Fabrico§0 is needed to keep them going at full speed.<BR>§lFire:§r The golem can remember an additional recipe. Accordingly, another set of slots becomes available for you to use in the workbench. §lOnly two§r of these upgrades may be applied to a single workbench.<BR>§lEarth:§r The golem can apply its Strength to the crafting process. Stronger golems craft more quickly. The potential boost isn't as great as the Air upgrade's, but golems affected by it not only aren't more prone to lethargy but will actually have greater endurance.
Automagy.research_page.GOLEMWORKBENCH_UPGRADE.3=§lEntropy:§r Recipes will be treated as shape patterns rather than exact instructions. Whatever item is in the first of the bottom slots will, when encountered in the recipe, be considered a placeholder. The golem will check each of the other items the workbench contains and determine whether substituting one for the placeholder would yield one of the products it has been told to make.<BR>For instance, putting a stick in one recipe slot, wool in another, and placing a stick in the left-most container slot could allow a single golem to craft all colors of wool if provided with the required dye.<BR>Fuzzy logic comes at a price, however. Golems using this upgrade are much more prone to lethargy.

Automagy.research_text.MOBLURE=Burning desire
Automagy.research_page.MOBLURE.1=While researching runes to use with the Nethermind, another property of the Ignis-imbued crystalline brain has come to light. When its energy is directed at the minds of creatures around it, it can instill certain powerful emotions.<BR>With this knowledge, you have created a device that draws nearby creatures toward itself. The awe and passion it instills blinds them to most everything else, including their surroundings - even when those surroundings include a sudden drop from great heights.<BR>Although runed obsidian is used in its construction, the result is something fundamentally different
Automagy.research_page.MOBLURE.2=and cannot be used as part of a Nethermind structure. In fact, on its own, none of the obsidian you've worked with so far is up to par with what you'd need here. Fortunately, the ancients have left some of their handiwork behind.<BR>To function, the Lure must be placed as part of a vertical line of §lObsidian Totem§r blocks (at least two). Susceptible creatures in a fairly wide horizontal area are affected but the vertical area is only as tall as the completed totem (maximum 4 blocks above and 4 below).<BR>The horizontal area covered can be greatly increased if a jar of §4Fames§0 is provided nearby.<BR>Tap the Lure with your §lwand§r to

Indeed, §lendermen§r under its spell will find themselves §lteleporting closer§r rather than away.<BR>A few creatures are completely immune, including your golems, some powerful entities, and primitive slimes.<BR>If multiple Lures are in range for a creature, then the one with the strongest lure will be the creature's

Automagy.research_text.DIMENSIONLURE=Called from beyond
Automagy.research_page.DIMENSIONLURE.1=The shared properties of the Nethermind and Siren's Lure have led you to theorize that the two could work together. With some alterations to the Lure and adaptation of the Nethermind structure, you should be able to conjure creatures rather than blocks.<BR>The §lDimensional Lure§r probes unknown corners of the Nether for targets, opening small rifts and luring creatures through them. To pull this off, a considerable amount of essentia must be consumed by both the Nethermind and the Lure. The §cIgnis§0 centi-vis requirements of the Nethermind will increase as well.<BR>The type of essentia needed depends
Automagy.research_page.DIMENSIONLURE.2=on the creature being targeted, and specific creatures must be targeted rather than simply drawing things in at random. (The bait must be tailored to the creature, after all.)<BR>The creature is determined by replacing basic runed obsidian in the Nethermind structure with specialized runed obsidian for that creature. Multiple types of creature- specifying runes can be used, but §lat least four§r (total, of any type) are required. You cannot mix creature- and block-specifying runes in the same structure.<BR>The Dimensional Lure block must be placed between six and ten blocks below the Nethermind with no solid blocks between them. A circle of basic runed obsidian must be placed
Automagy.research_page.DIMENSIONLURE.3=around it, as specified on the previous page. Conjured creatures will appear between this platform and the structure above.<BR>Once the structures are in place, first tap the Lure with your wand to activate it and then tap the Nethermind block to begin drawing creatures in.<LINE>Unfortunately, this process is not entirely stable. There is a chance that various negative effects may occur instead of or in addition to a creature being summoned. To combat this, §lObsidian Totem§r pillars can be placed in the four corners around the circle. The taller the pillar, the more stability it
Automagy.research_page.DIMENSIONLURE.4=provides. (Maximum four totem blocks per pillar.)

The disc takes up much of the mirror's frame and its void metal origins allow it to bond with the glass in a way other metals cannot so it may adapt as necessary to
Automagy.research_page.MIRRORINPUT.3=intercept whatever chaotic path the streams may take in the void.<BR>A conflux disc is fairly costly to create initially, but from one, many more can be produced relatively easily. For this reason, it is advisable to always hold one in reserve.

Automagy.research_name.MIRRORMULTIDEST=Dispersing Mirror
Automagy.research_text.MIRRORMULTIDEST=Direct delivery
Automagy.research_page.MIRRORMULTIDEST.1=Up to now, linking multiple requisition tomes with one Inventarium has had limited utility. Requested items weren't associated with any specific tome, let alone earmarked to be delivered to them. Now that you've found a way to tap into mirrors' transdimensional streams, that is about to change.<BR>If your delivery golems are set to drop items off at a §lDispersing Mirror§r (directly or indirectly) that is linked to the same Inventarium Core as their Golemic Taskmaster, then the mirror can send items to a mirror close to the requisition tome.<BR>To link a dispersing mirror to the Inventarium Core, right-click it with
Automagy.research_page.MIRRORMULTIDEST.2=your wand. The maximum distance it can be from the core is increased by order crystal clusters near the core. A §lMemory Block§r must be installed for each dispersing mirror. (See "Supply and Demand" for how to do this.)<BR>After the mirror is linked, you must specify each tome's destination mirror using the "Mirrors" button in the tome's GUI. Either a standard magic mirror or a melding mirror can be used as a tome's output location.<BR>Note that items sent to a dispersing mirror which aren't earmarked for a specific destination will be rejected and spat out by the dispersing mirror, so make sure all requisition tomes have an output mirror set. (You may also want a failsafe in place to
Automagy.research_page.MIRRORMULTIDEST.3=pick up loose items and take them to a default destination or put them away.)
