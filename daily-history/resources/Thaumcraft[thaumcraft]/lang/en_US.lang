# General Focus Upgrades
focus.upgrade.potency.name=Potency
focus.upgrade.potency.text=This upgrade increases the damage or strength of the focus's powers. The exact damage increase varies from focus to focus, but is usually about 20% per level.
focus.upgrade.frugal.name=Frugal
focus.upgrade.frugal.text=This upgrade reduces the vis cost of activating the focus's powers by 10% per level.
focus.upgrade.treasure.name=Treasure
focus.upgrade.treasure.text=This upgrade acts like the Fortune or Looting enchantments. It increases the chance of getting more/better loot.
focus.upgrade.enlarge.name=Enlarge
focus.upgrade.enlarge.text=This upgrade increases how large an area the focus's powers affect, or increases the number of targets affected.
focus.upgrade.extend.name=Extend
focus.upgrade.extend.text=This upgrade increases the duration of any effects the upgrade might create.
focus.upgrade.architect.name=Architect
focus.upgrade.architect.text=This upgrade gives a lot more control over the area certain foci affect. The exact area that will be affected is displayed and you can change the size using the misc wand toggle key (default G). Sneak+G allows you to toggle which dimensions you can change.
#
# Specific Focus Upgrades
focus.upgrade.chainlightning.name=Chain Lightning
focus.upgrade.chainlightning.text=This upgrade reduces the speed at which the focus fires bolts, but the damage is increased and the bolt can chain to up to two additional targets.
focus.upgrade.earthshock.name=Earth Shock
focus.upgrade.earthshock.text=Instead of a bolt of lightning, the focus now lobs a ball of electrical energy. It inflicts damage in an area around where it hits and leaves the ground dangerously electrified for some time.
focus.upgrade.fireball.name=Fireball
focus.upgrade.fireball.text=The focus will now produce a explosive ball of fire you can hurl at your foes. The Alchemists Fire upgrade causes it to also set the ground aflame around the point of impact.
focus.upgrade.firebeam.name=Fire Beam
focus.upgrade.firebeam.text=The focus now emits a narrow stream of fire instead of a wide swathe. It burns through anything it touches inflicting massive damage.
focus.upgrade.batbombs.name=Bat Bombs
focus.upgrade.batbombs.text=This upgrade will make the summoned firebats even more volatile. They always explode when they contact their target and the explosion will be a lot more potent than normal.
focus.upgrade.devilbats.name=Devil Bats
focus.upgrade.devilbats.text=With this upgrade applied the summoned bats are larger, tougher and nastier. They will never explode, but keep attacking their target till it expires or they are slain. 
focus.upgrade.vampirebats.name=Vampire Bats
focus.upgrade.vampirebats.text=This upgrade changes the summoned bats into vampire bats. Not only will they suck the life out of their target to replenish their own, but some of the stolen life force is given to their summoner.
focus.upgrade.scattershot.name=Scattershot
focus.upgrade.scattershot.text=Instead of a single shard of ice, the focus will now fire multiple shards. Each shard does minimal damage, but a concentrated volley of them can do significant damage to a single target. 
focus.upgrade.iceboulder.name=Ice Boulder
focus.upgrade.iceboulder.text=The focus will now create a large boulder of ice. The boulder has a tendancy to bounce around making it deadly in skilled hands. 
focus.upgrade.alchemistsfire.name=Alchemist's Fire
focus.upgrade.alchemistsfire.text=This increases the potency of the elemental fire in the focus. Any targets set alight will burn for much longer.
focus.upgrade.alchemistsfrost.name=Alchemist's Frost
focus.upgrade.alchemistsfrost.text=This increases the potency of the elemental cold in the focus. When the focus targets or damages a creature it will be chilled and slowed significantly.
focus.upgrade.nightshade.name=Nightshade
focus.upgrade.nightshade.text=Normally the Pech's curse focus inflicts one of a small handful of debilitating effects. With this upgrade it will inflict all of them at once.
focus.upgrade.silktouch.name=Silk Touch
focus.upgrade.silktouch.text=Like the enchantment of the same name, this upgrade allows you to pick up harvested blocks as-is instead of gaining the normal drops.
focus.upgrade.seeker.name=Seeker
focus.upgrade.seeker.text=This upgrade makes the orbs created by the primal focus seek out the nearest living target and not wander all over the place. This makes them a lot more stable which also means they won't do anything unusual beyond exploding.
focus.upgrade.dowsing.name=Dowsing
focus.upgrade.dowsing.text=This upgrade gives the excavation focus a small chance to mine native clusters instead of normal ores. These clusters usually give double the number of ingots when smelted.

# Research entries
tc.research_name.RESEARCH=Research
tc.research_text.RESEARCH=How you discover things
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.1=Before you can build most thaumaturgical items and blocks, you first need to discover how to do so. There are several steps in this process:<BR>(1) Exploring the world and examining blocks, items and creatures with a §5Thaumometer§0<BR><BR>(2) Taking the research points you gathered from the first step and expanding your aspect knowledge with the §5Research Table§0<BR><BR>(3) Using the aspects you know and discovering practical knowledge and recipes with the §5Research Table§0.<LINE>
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.2=§l      §n(1) Exploration§r<BR><BR>You cannot perform research without research points, and the best way to gain research points is by exploration and examining objects in the world.<BR>The first thing you will need to do is construct a §5Thaumometer§0 (see next page). By pointing the §5Thaumometer§0 at objects or creatures and holding the right mouse button you will start examining them. The process does not take long, but your movement speed is reduced while it is occurring.<BR>Once complete the §5Thaumometer§0 will display what aspects the object contains. In the bottom right of the screen you will also see a summary of the aspects and research points 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.3=you discovered.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research1.png:0:0:255:208:.5</IMG>You will initially not be able to examine all objects since you have not discovered their component aspects. For example, an object containing the Lux aspect can only be examined if you have previously discovered the Lux aspect, or know
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.4=the two aspects that combine to create it.<BR>The very first time you discover an aspect by examining something you gain two more research points than you would have normally.<BR>Objects and creatures can usually only ever be examined once.<BR>Occasionally examining something will reveal additional clues and insights into thaumaturgical research, unlocking subjects that you can research further.<BR>Research discovered in this fashion will have amber icons.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.5=§l   §n(2) Combining Aspects§r<BR><BR>Once you have gathered some research points you can attempt to combine them into compound aspects within a research table.<BR>To craft a research table simply place two §5tables§0 next to each other and click on them with a set of Scribing Tools. The recipe for tables is listed under the §5Artiface§0 research category.<BR>If you open the research tables inventory, you will see an interface as pictured on the right.<BR>The scribing tools you used to craft the table will be located in slot §l1§r. 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.6=<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:0:0:128:83:1</IMG>You should see all the primal aspects (and possibly some compound aspects) listed in the area marked §l3§r with varying amounts attached to them. When you enter a world for the first time, every player is assigned a small pool of primal aspects to get them started.<BR>If you had done some exploring with
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.7=the thaumometer beforehand then you might have a significant number of primal and compound aspects listed here.<BR>You can now start combining aspects into more complex compound aspects but simply clicking on those you wish to combine or dragging it to the runic circles in area §l4§r. The selected aspects will appear in area §l4§r and when you have two selected pressing the purple button will attempt to combine them. If successful you should see what was gained in the bottom right and it should appear in area §l3§r.<BR>The component aspects are consumed even if the combination did not result in valid compound aspect.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.8=§l   §n(3) Primary Research§r<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research2.png:0:88:255:158:.5</IMG>You need to be carrying a set of scribing tools and paper for this step.<BR>If you open your Thaumonomicon you will see all the knowledge have and also all the knowledge that you are now able to pursue.<BR>Flashing square or round icons represent primary researches.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.9=If you can read their title (instead of seeing strange runes) you are simply able to click on them. Paper and ink will be consumed from your inventory and you will gain a research note. You can now take this research note to the table to start researching it by placing it in slot §l2§r.<BR>Section §l5§r will now display a sheet of paper covered in hexagonal tiles with aspect icons around the outer edge. If you see question mark icons it means you do not know that aspect yet and you will need to learn it first.<LINE> 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.10=To complete your research you simply need to connect and activate all the aspects. You do this by dragging an aspect to a hex adjacent to it that is either composed of the target aspect, or can be combined with another aspect to form the target aspect.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research3.png:0:0:150:95:.75</IMG>Placing an aspect consumes one research point. If you make a mistake you can click on the aspect to remove it, but you will not regain the research point. 
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.11=You continue doing this until you have formed a pattern connecting all the starting aspects. The outer aspects need not be connected to all the others, they simply need to form a connected whole.<BR>Once this is done the research will complete and the research note will turn into a discovery.<LINE>NOTE: Placing and removing aspects from the hex grid consumes ink from your scribing tools. If it runs out you will not be able to proceed until you refill it.
tc.research_page.RESEARCH.12=§l    §nSecondary Research§r<BR>Hexagonal icons indicate Secondary research. Much like primary research you just need to click on them. However instead of gaining a research note, you will simply learn the research directly. Secondary research does have an aspect cost you need to pay, but they do not require you to be carrying scribing tools or paper.
#
tc.research_name.KNOWFRAG=Knowledge Fragments
tc.research_text.KNOWFRAG=Fragments of lost lore
tc.research_page.KNOWFRAG.1=In your travels you might happen upon fragments of ancient and lost knowledge. On their own they are only worth a few research points when used, but if you gather enough of them together you might gain unique research that you can pursue. Usually the research they reveal cannot be gained through normal means.<BR>The fragments of knowledge can on occasion lead to a false theory, but this will be revealed when you attempt to research it. When this happens most of your knowledge fragments will be returned to you and it usually means you have exhausted all current avenues of research into lost knowledge.
#
tc.research_name.ASPECTS=Aspects of Magic
tc.research_text.ASPECTS=The building blocks of magic
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.1=Every item, object or creature is bound by varying mystical elements known as §5aspects§0. Aspects describe the object's makeup and bent towards the magical elements. A simple stone may possess the aspect of Terra while more complex items like trees or even creatures can be made up of various different aspects in varying amounts. There are close to 50 known aspects with more being discovered all the time.<LINE>There are two main types of aspects: §5Primal§0 and §5Compound§0.
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.2=§lPrimal Aspects§r are the most basic types of aspects and there are only 6 of them: §6Aer§0 (air), §2Terra§0 (earth), §cIgnis§0 (fire), §3Aqua§0 (Water), §7Ordo§0 (order), §8Perditio§0 (entropy).<BR>These form the basic building blocks of all other aspects.<BR>§lCompound Aspects§r are built from two other aspects. The simplest compound aspects are made from two primal aspects, but it is possible to have incredibly complex compound aspects made from successive layers of simpler aspects.<BR>The simplest example of such a compound aspect, is the aspect of Victus (life), which is a combination of §2Terra§0 and §3Aqua§0. 
tc.research_page.ASPECTS.3=To view what aspects an item possesses, simply hover your cursor over the item and press sneak (shift), and you will see what aspects that item has and what amounts of each. You will first need to study the item however, until then the aspects will remain unknown.<LINE>Aspects that have somehow been separated from their object and purified is known as §5Vis§0 and is very valuable: both as a crafting ingredient and as a subject for magical research.<BR>Vis is most often bound into wands, but it is also possible to store it as a magical liquid. Vis stored as a liquid is known as §5Essentia§0.
#
tc.research_name.NODES=Auras and Nodes
tc.research_text.NODES=Magic is everywhere
tc.research_page.NODES.1=The §5Aura§0 is a field of magical energy prevalent throughout the world. Its origin is unclear. Some believe it is the accumulated life force of living beings, while others believe it to merely be another type of energy seeping in from some other place. The last theory seems to be most likely, as the aura is often found surrounding a node of concentrated mystical energy known as an §5Aura Node§0.<BR>Each aura node has a base amount of magical energy it can contain and this energy is aligned to one or more aspects. It is usually aligned to §5Primal Aspects§0, but rarely a node may contain §5Compound Aspects§0. 
tc.research_page.NODES.2=The aspects within an aura node can be tapped by a thaumaturge for his own purposes. The simplest way to do so is with the use of a wand.<BR>Energy that has been harvested in this manner is known as vis.<LINE>Aura nodes are hard to see with the naked eye, but faint glimmers of light often betray their presence. The §5Thaumometer§0 makes nodes slightly easier to find, as looking through its lens makes them clearly visible.<BR>§4Important:§0 Caution must be taken when draining a node. There is a small chance that when a specific type of aspect within a node is completely drained, it may 
tc.research_page.NODES.3=disappear or harm the integrity of the node.<BR>It is possible for the node to disappear completely if all the aspects are used up.<LINE>Fortunately most nodes replenish their aspects over time and if properly maintained can provide a clever thaumaturge with all the vis he could want.<BR>Nodes react in interesting ways to other nearby nodes and bigger nodes tend to drain the vis out of their smaller neighbors to increase their own girth.

tc.research_name.DECONSTRUCTOR=Deconstruction table
tc.research_text.DECONSTRUCTOR=When taking a good look just isn't enough
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.1=There comes a point in any thaumaturge's career where he is unable to progress with research due to his lack of knowledge. <BR>One possible recourse is the Deconstruction Table. The table allows you to break down objects into their simplest parts which you can examine. There are limits however - the table breaks compound aspects into their component aspects until only primal aspects remain. During this process much knowledge is lost and at best the thaumaturge can hope for is a single piece of primal knowledge.<BR>For example iron (Metallum) 
tc.research_page.DECONSTRUCTOR.2=will be simplified into §2Terra§0 and §8Ordo§0, only one of which will have a chance of being discovered.<BR>It is also fairly slow and the fewer aspects and object has, the lower the chance to discover something.

tc.research_text.BASICTHAUMATURGY=Your first tool
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.1=The casting wand is your most basic, but also your most important tool. It is what you use to craft objects, activate blocks like the crucible, and countless other tasks.<BR>The most basic wand stores a very limited amount of magical energy (called vis) that it uses to perform its tasks. The replenish the energy in a wand, you must right-click and hold to draw vis from an aura node.<BR>While holding a wand you will see a indicator on the top left of the screen that shows how much vis is stored within the wand.
tc.research_page.BASICTHAUMATURGY.2=Holding shift will display exact numbers held by the wand and any possible discounts you have to performing magical tasks.<BR>Wands are always constructed by the combination of a rod and two end-caps. As you progress with your studies, you are sure you will discover different materials that you can use to craft rods and caps to make powerful wands. Only the basic wand can be put together in a normal crafting table. All other wands require the §5Arcane Workbench§0 and will cost vis to construct.<BR>The basic wand is constructed from mundane wood and iron, both of which make poor materials for working magic.

tc.research_name.GRATE=Item Grate
tc.research_text.GRATE=Let the good things in
tc.research_page.GRATE.1=The item grate allows you to toggle it open or close it with your hand, or with a redstone signal. If in the open position, any dropped items will simply fall right through it.<BR>Items can also be piped into the top of an item grate using a hopper or other means and if open, it will be ejected out the bottom.

tc.research_name.THAUMOMETER=Thaumometer
tc.research_text.THAUMOMETER=Measuring Magic
tc.research_page.THAUMOMETER.1=This Thaumometer is one of the most useful and important tools in a thaumaturgists arsenal, second only to the wand.<BR>Firstly it allows you to scan objects, creatures or mystical phenomena and determine their magical make-up. You simply need to hold the right mouse button and wait.<BR>Secondly it makes discovering nodes easier, as they become clearly visible if viewed through the Thaumometer's lens - even through solid objects!

tc.research_name.THAUMIUM=Magical Metallurgy
tc.research_text.THAUMIUM=Where metals meet magic
tc.research_page.THAUMIUM.1=Metals have proven to be quite easy to manipulate via thaumaturgical principles. Your first experiments have led to discovery of Thaumium.<BR>Thaumium is the result of infusing base metals with raw magical energy. The result is a metal harder than iron with the ability to accept enchantments beyond that which iron is normally capable of.<BR>A metal such as this has many applications in the crafting of more advanced thaumaturgical devices.<BR>It can also be used to craft tools, arms and armor in a crafting table using the normal recipes.

tc.research_text.NITOR=Mystical Flame
tc.research_page.NITOR.1=This flame seems to be fuelled by magic itself. The number of uses for an ever burning flame seems endless, but unfortunately it seems to produce much more light than heat. Despite that it could still prove to be a steady source of energy.<BR>Nitor can also be placed in the world to act as a magical light source.

tc.research_text.CAP_thaumium=Magical wand caps
tc.research_page.CAP_thaumium.1=Thaumium is known for its ability to store and absorb magic, so using it to craft wand caps is a logical choice. It is very efficient at focusing vis of all types.<BR>Crafting these wand caps in an arcane worktable is not sufficient - they need to be infused with additional magical energy to make them usable.
#
tc.research_name.CAP_silver=Silver Wand Caps
tc.research_text.CAP_silver=Capping things off with a little less style
tc.research_page.CAP_silver.1=Silver has similar properties to gold when used as a wand cap, but it slightly more efficient at channeling the four elemental primals (fire, earth, air and water).<BR>Crafting these wand caps in an arcane worktable is not sufficient - they need to be infused with additional magical energy to make them usable.

tc.research_text.SCEPTRE=Made to task
tc.research_page.SCEPTRE.1=Crafting scepters are specialized wands made to be used to craft mystical objects and nothing else. Foci cannot be attached to them, but they have several features that still make them worthwhile using.<BR>Firstly, they have an additional 10% vis discount above and beyond what their caps would normally grant.<BR>Secondly they are able to hold 50% more vis than their cores would normally allow.<BR>Like other wands they can be crafted using most combinations of rods and caps - just a few examples are given on the next page.

tc.research_text.ROD_greatwood_staff=Wizards staves have knobs on the end
tc.research_page.ROD_greatwood_staff.1=Wands are the stock and trade of the thaumaturge, but sometimes you want more bang for your buck. Magical staves are basically just bigger wands. They are able to store more vis.<BR>Since they are physically larger and sturdier than a wand, they can actually be used as weapons in an emergency.<BR>Unfortunately this also makes it unsuitable for the intricate workmanship and fine control required by an arcane workbench or similar crafting.
tc.research_page.ROD_greatwood_staff.2=A staff made from greatwood has more than double the vis storage potential of a greatwood wand, being able to store up to 125 vis of each type.<BR>Note: You still need to add caps to a stave rod, just like you would for a wand.

tc.research_text.ROD_primal_staff=Elemental power combined
tc.research_page.ROD_primal_staff.1=This core pulses with latent energy.<BR>It combines all the features off the lesser stave cores - it has the vis storage capacity of the silverwood core and is able to replenish its vis stores like the various primal wand cores.<BR>Lastly it adds one level of potency to any foci used with it.<BR>This is truly a potent tool in any thaumaturge's arsenal.<BR>Note: You still need to add caps to this stave rod, just like you would for a wand.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSFIRE=Wand Foci
tc.research_text.FOCUSFIRE=Form meets Function
tc.research_page.FOCUSFIRE.1=Some careful experimentation has shown you a way to expand the abilities of even the most basic wand.<BR>By combining crystalline vis shards with quartz crystals and infusing them with magic, you are able to align the crystals into a mystical matrix.<BR>If the proper types and amounts of vis is focused through this matrix, it will reshape the raw magical energies into something useful, controlled, and geared to a specific task. 
tc.research_page.FOCUSFIRE.2=Adding a focus to your wand is a simple task - simply press F while holding the wand, and any foci you a carrying will show up in a radial menu allowing you to choose from any of the ones you are carrying with a simple click.<LINE>Your initial experiments involved the shaping of fire, and the resulting focus proved to be a simple, but useful tool.<BR>It is capable of sending forth a cone of elemental fire, burning all in its wake.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSFROST=Wand Focus: Frost
tc.research_text.FOCUSFROST=Revenge is a dish best served cold
tc.research_page.FOCUSFROST.1=This focus is capable of hurling chunks of ice.<BR>Care must be taken when aiming, as the ice chunks tend to bounce off solid objects. This can be used to your advantage however as you can bounce the shards around corners, or even hit multiple foes. 
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSSHOCK=Wand Focus: Shock
tc.research_text.FOCUSSHOCK=Thunder and Lightning
tc.research_page.FOCUSSHOCK.1=This focus is capable of focusing elemental energy into bolts of lightning that you can hurl at your enemies.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSEXCAVATION=Wand Focus: Excavation
tc.research_text.FOCUSEXCAVATION=Terra Terror
tc.research_page.FOCUSEXCAVATION.1=This focus turns your wand into a tool capable of moving vast amounts of earth and stone with little effort.<BR>Simply point it at what you want to excavate and the magic does the rest. Tougher materials take longer to mine, and anything other than earth, stone or similar materials will take much longer to mine.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSTRADE=Wand Focus: Equal Trade
tc.research_text.FOCUSTRADE=This for That
tc.research_page.FOCUSTRADE.1=You can use this focus to trade dozens of blocks in the world with some you are carrying.<BR>You must first choose the block you wish to change other blocks into by sneaking and right clicking on the desired block. When you then left-click on another block it will turn into the target block. Right clicking will transform a whole swathe of blocks.<BR>You must be carrying enough target blocks, and the transformed blocks will replace them in your inventory. Only blocks with at least one face adjacent to open air or non-solid blocks will be transformed.

tc.research_name.FOCUSPORTABLEHOLE=Wand Focus: Portable Hole
tc.research_text.FOCUSPORTABLEHOLE=Never be without an exit again
tc.research_page.FOCUSPORTABLEHOLE.1=You have succeeded in using vis to create extra dimensional spaces. Using this focus on a wall or other surface will create an extra dimensional passage leading to the other side.<BR>This 'hole' only remains open for a few seconds and drains vis from the wand depending on its depth.<BR>Extra dimensional holes cannot be created through certain kinds of matter or particularly complex objects.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSWARDING=Wand Focus: Warding
tc.research_text.FOCUSWARDING=Protecting what is yours
tc.research_page.FOCUSWARDING.1=This powerful focus has a very interesting ability. When used on a block it will create an invisible, protective barrier around that block. From that point on the block will not be able to be removed or destroyed until you once again use the wand on it.<BR>The focus can be used on most simple blocks and they will retain many of their normal properties, though while warded those blocks will effectively become frozen in time.<BR>While holding a wand with this focus you will be able to see all blocks that you (and only you) have warded.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSPRIMAL=Wand Focus: Primal
tc.research_text.FOCUSPRIMAL=Raw Magic
tc.research_page.FOCUSPRIMAL.1=What madness possessed you to create this thing? This focus seems wildly dangerous and only a lunatic will attempt to use it anywhere but the most controlled environments.<BR>Granted, the orb of raw primal energy it creates is quite devastating, but its path of travel is erratic at best and downright malicious at worst.<BR>It does beg further study however: The orb shows some interesting dimensional properties and it exhibits energy patterns you have only seen in wisps and aura nodes.
#
tc.research_name.FOCUSPOUCH=Focus Pouch
tc.research_text.FOCUSPOUCH=Convenient carry container for your foci.
tc.research_page.FOCUSPOUCH.1=Once you have gathered a sizable collection of foci it is quite annoying to carry them all with you. This pouch solves that problem.<BR>Whenever you change the focus on your wand, it will check this pouch first and any foci that get removed will be placed inside it first. You can also right-click the pouch to place or remove foci by hand.<BR>It can also be carried in your belt bauble slot.

tc.research_name.ARCTABLE=Arcane Worktable
tc.research_text.ARCTABLE=Crafting with magic
tc.research_page.ARCTABLE.1=To create an Arcane Worktable simply right-click with a wand on a table you have placed in the world. The Arcane Worktable serves the same purpose as a normal crafting table, with a few key exceptions.<BR>Apart from normal crafting recipes, it can also craft some of the items unique to Thaumaturgy. To do that you need to place a wand in the top-right slot. This will allow you to craft items that require vis by drawing the energy directly from the wand.<BR>The vis required to craft an item will be shown in the six circular symbols surrounding the crafting grid.
#
tc.research_name.RESTABLE=Research Table
tc.research_text.RESTABLE=To gather knowledge
tc.research_page.RESTABLE.1=The Research table is created by placing two tables next to each other and then clicking on them with Scribing tools.<BR>The research table is the most important tool for any thaumaturge. It is used to unlock all the hidden secrets of the universe and discover new ways of harnessing magic. 
#
tc.research_name.THAUMONOMICON=Thaumonomicon
tc.research_text.THAUMONOMICON=A Repository of Knowledge
tc.research_page.THAUMONOMICON.1=To craft the Thaumonomicon, you must simply use your wand on a bookshelf placed in the world.<BR>The Thaumonomicon is a reference book of all things thaumaturgical. It lists all the discoveries you have made so far and gives you a general impression of how many there are still to be made.<BR>Whenever you successfully research something and use the scroll, it will automatically be added to this book. You can then browse through the discoveries and click on them to be shown more detailed information regarding them as well as any crafting recipes associated with those discoveries. 
#
tc.research_name.CRUCIBLE=Basic Alchemy
tc.research_text.CRUCIBLE=Bubble and Boil
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.1=To craft the Crucible, you must simply use your wand on a cauldron placed in the world.<BR>The crucible is an important tool for any thaumaturge. It allows him to render physical objects into their component Essentia and recombine it again as he wishes.<BR>The crucible needs to be placed over a source of constant heat and filled with water. Once the water starts boiling you simply throw any items you wish into the crucible and they will be broken down into their component Essentia.<BR>If you know the proper formula and the mix of essentia within the    
tc.research_page.CRUCIBLE.2=crucible is correct, you can then drop a special item into the crucible known as a Catalyst. The catalyst draws the essentia into itself and transforms into a whole new item that the crucible then ejects.<BR>Any leftover Essentia remains within the crucible for further use, but it is not a good idea to leave essentia within a crucible for too long.<BR>Crafting also uses some of the water within the crucible and you will eventually need to refill it.<BR>Essentia within the crucible is constantly degrading. Compound essentia degrades into one of its component aspects, and Primal essentia simply evaporates.

tc.research_name.CORESORTING=Golem Core: Sorting
tc.research_text.CORESORTING=Keeping things in order
tc.research_page.CORESORTING.1=This core works much like an Empty core with one key difference: It only takes an item from its home inventory if it already exists in one of its marked inventories.

tc.research_name.DISTILESSENTIA=Essentia Distillation
tc.research_text.DISTILESSENTIA=Harvesting essentia
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.1=In the future you will definitely need to have ready access to multiple different kinds of aspects - not just primal aspects drawn from your wand.<BR>Using basic alchemical principles you have devised a way to break down objects and convert them into essentia.<BR>The first step in this process requires an §lAlchemical Furnace§r. The alchemical furnace works much like a normal furnace by burning coal to produce heat, but instead of smelting ore into metal, it breaks down objects into a slurry of raw, unprocessed essentia.
tc.research_page.DISTILESSENTIA.2=The next step in the process is to take the essentia slurry and distill it using an §lArcane Alembic§r.<BR>To work, arcane alembics need to be placed on top of an alchemical furnace. The essentia slurry will slowly be drawn into the alembic and the individual aspected essentia separated out.<BR>If the alchemical furnace is being powered by alumentum, this distillation process is much faster.<BR>You can stack up to 5 different alembics on top of a single furnace.<BR>The essentia can then be extracted out of an alembic using phials.

tc.research_text.JARLABEL=Storing and organizing essentia
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.1=Essentia can be stored in §lWarded Jars§r.<BR>Warded jars can be placed in world and is able to store essentia virtually indefinitely. The enchantment placed on the jars also makes adding or extracting essentia a breeze.<BR>Jars can be filled from an alembic by clicking with the jar directly on the alembic. They can also be filled and emptied using phials.<BR>What is more they make an excellent storage medium for jams and preserves.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.2=Shift clicking on jars and alembics with an empty hand will empty them.<BR>As long as a jar contains some essentia, you can attach a §lJar Label§r to it.<BR>This label will 'lock' the jar to that type of essentia and it will not be able to accept any other kind of essentia.<BR>You can remove a label by shift clicking with an empty hand on the side of the jar containing the label. Take care not to shift click on any other side as it will empty the jar as normal.
tc.research_page.JARLABEL.3=You can place a label in a crafting bench with a phial of essentia to assign an aspect to it and when placed on an empty jar it will automatically lock the jar to that aspect. The essentia used in the recipe is not consumed.<BR>Placing it on a filled jar will change the label to the jar's essentia type.<LINE>A label can be made blank again by simply placing it by itself in a crafting grid.

tc.research_name.INFERNALFURNACE=Infernal Furnace
tc.research_text.INFERNALFURNACE=Hot enough?
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.1=By harnessing raw §cIgnis§0 within a furnace crafted from obsidian and netherbrick you have created a highly efficient and fuel free furnace. So efficient in fact, that occasionally it will produce bonus materials in the form of nuggets or other items.<BR>While this is essentially free, it is also very slow unless the furnace gets a new supply of §cIgnis§0 essentia or vis every now and again. This can be done by any methods you have discovered so far, or still will discover.
tc.research_page.INFERNALFURNACE.2=It should also be noted that the occasional bit of Flux escapes into the environment.<BR>Items you wish to smelt needs to be dropped into the top of the furnace and will be spit out the front.

tc.research_name.BELLOWS=Arcane Bellows
tc.research_text.BELLOWS=Stoking the flames
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.1=The Arcane Bellows performs much the same function as its mundane counterpart, the only difference is that it happily pumps away by itself sending forth a stream of never-ending air.<BR>Attaching it to an Infernal Furnace has shown some interesting results. The elemental infused air not only stokes the flames increasing its smelting speed, but causes them to burn much purer, resulting in a reduction of flux generated and increasing the chance of creating bonus nuggets and other materials when smelting.
tc.research_page.BELLOWS.2=They can also be attached to normal or alchemical furnaces to increase their speed.<BR>It is also possible to attach them to crucibles to reduce the time it takes for their water to boil.<BR>Bellows can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal.<BR>You are confident more uses will reveal themselves eventually.

#
tc.research_name.INFUSION=Infusion
tc.research_text.INFUSION=Mystical fusion
tc.research_page.INFUSION.1=Arcane crafting and alchemy can go only so far. Something better is needed to create truly powerful mystical objects.<BR>Infusion crafting is the process of infusing a single object with magical energy and the properties of other objects. You could, for example, infuse a stone with §6Aer§0 vis and a feather and it would result in a very light stone.<BR>As is usual with thaumaturgy, things are not quite that simple. To even get started with infusion crafting there are several things you need: A Runic Matrix, arcane pedestals and a ready supply of magic in the form of essentia. 
tc.research_page.INFUSION.2=Once you have your Runic Matrix properly placed into a structure commonly known as an Infusion Altar, you can begin to craft.<BR>The central pedestal located under the matrix is where the item you wish to infuse will go. You will also need several more pedestals placed around the altar where you can place the blocks and items you wish to infuse into the target object. Lastly you will need warded jars or similar essentia containers holding the requisite amount of vis.<BR>Once all this is gathered you can click on the Runic Matrix with a wand to start the crafting process.<BR>During the first stage of crafting essentia will be drained
tc.research_page.INFUSION.3=from nearby sources. Crafting will stall of there is insufficient essentia available - something that you do not want as will be explained on following pages.<BR>Once all the required essentia has been infused into the target object, the other objects will have their essential essence drained. Only when this is done will the crafting process complete.<LINE>Infusion crafting is not without risks. The entire process involves forcing vast energies into a single object. Unpredictable things tend to happen.<BR>Usually one of the fusion objects get
tc.research_page.INFUSION.4=knocked off a pedestal, or flux gets generated, but more catastrophic events are not unheard of.<BR>The longer crafting continues due to unresolved problems like lack of vis or dropped items, the greater the chance of something bad happening.<BR>These effects can be reduced by various means. Firstly you wish to keep the entire fusion structure as symmetrical as possible - take careful note of where you place pedestals and make sure they are balanced with other pedestals on the opposite side of the altar. When placing fusion items into them you may wish to keep them balanced as well. Lastly you can place occult paraphernalia around the  
tc.research_page.INFUSION.5=altar in symmetrical formations (things like candles, skulls, crystals, etc.). These will have the effect of reducing instability.<IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research5.png:128:0:128:136:1</IMG>

tc.research_name.HOVERHARNESS=Thaumostatic Harness
tc.research_text.HOVERHARNESS=Is it a bird?
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.1=You have finally managed to unlock the secret of flight. You have created a harness that anchors itself to the Thaumic Field using thaumostatic energy allowing you to defy gravity. You think quantum's and quarks might also be involved somehow.<BR>Unusually the only vis required to power this harness is added during its creation process. Instead the fuel it requires for flight is raw Potentia. Simply right click while holding the harness to insert filled jars.<BR>Pressing 'H' while wearing the harness activates or deactivates it.
tc.research_page.HOVERHARNESS.2=While active the harness will constantly use Potentia.<BR>It can be enchanted with the Haste enchant to increase the speed at which you move while flying.<BR>The harness will not reduce your block breaking speed while you are flying with it.
#
tc.research_name.HOVERGIRDLE=Thaumostatic Girdle
tc.research_text.HOVERGIRDLE=Is it a plane?
tc.research_page.HOVERGIRDLE.1=This girdle is designed to be used with the Thaumostatic Harness. On its own it has very little lifting power - it has just enough to prevent most fall damage.<BR>When worn with the harness however it greatly increases the speed at which you are able to fly. The only drawback is that the harness will consume slightly more fuel than normal.
#
tc.research_name.ADVANCEDGOLEM=Advanced Golems
tc.research_text.ADVANCEDGOLEM=Maybe I should think this through...
tc.research_page.ADVANCEDGOLEM.1=You have discovered a way of improving golems in several minor, but significant ways.<BR>Firstly, golems that go through this process are able to hold one additional upgrade, though they can never have more than two upgrades of a single type.<BR>Secondly, they move slightly faster.<BR>Thirdly, they have a slightly greater sight radius.<BR>You are sure the malevolent intent in their eyes is just your imagination.  
#
tc.research_name.ARCANEBORE=Arcane Bore
tc.research_text.ARCANEBORE=Mining evolved
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.1=You have discovered a device capable of extending the range and power of an Excavation focus. Of even greater use is the fact that the machine can do so without your constant supervision. You merely need to place it on a specially constructed base, point it in the right direction with a wand and apply a redstone signal.<BR>The arcane bore requires two things to function. The first is an excavation focus placed in its leftmost inventory slot. Any enchantments applied to the focus will also alter the functions of the bore. 
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.2=Secondly you need to place any kind of pickaxe into the rightmost slot. The material of the pickaxe will have little effect on the operation of the bore, but the greater its durability, the longer it will last. Like the wand, any enchantments or special abilities of the pickaxe will also be applied to whatever the bore mines.<BR>An arcane bore can only be placed above or below an arcane bore base. Any items mined will be ejected from the base in the direction its nozzle is pointing.<BR>It will eject into an inventory if possible. This direction can be changed with a wand.
tc.research_page.ARCANEBORE.3=The bore can be powered with §8Perditio§0 essentia or vis which will greatly speed up the rate at which it mines. Vis or essentia can be provided by pipes and/or relays as normal.<BR>One point of §8Perditio§0 essentia will speed the bore for the next 20 blocks mined. Alternatively 5 CV is required per block mined and the bore can accept up to 100 CV per tick.

tc.research_name.LEVITATOR=Arcane Levitator
tc.research_text.LEVITATOR=Next best thing to flying
tc.research_page.LEVITATOR.1=While not true flight, the Arcane Levitator is the next best thing.<BR>When placed the levitator lifts any item or creature above it up to 10 blocks into the air. A sneaking creature or player will be slowly lowered.<BR>Each levitator placed upon another increases the range at which it can lift entities by 10 blocks, so a stack of 3 can lift entities up to 30 blocks.<BR>Levitators can be deactivated by applying a redstone signal to them.

tc.research_name.ARCANEEAR=Arcane Ear
tc.research_text.ARCANEEAR=Shhh, do you hear something?
tc.research_page.ARCANEEAR.1=The Arcane Ear is a device that is capable of detecting the sound emitted from nearby note blocks. If it hears a note it recognizes it will emit a short redstone pulse.<BR>The Arcane Ear needs to be tuned in a manner identical to note blocks, the tone and note it listens for depends on the material it is placed upon.
#
tc.research_name.MIRROR=Mirror Magic
tc.research_text.MIRROR=Through the looking glass
tc.research_page.MIRROR.1=You are now able to enchant a pair of magical mirrors that act as doorways to the void between the worlds. Anything shoved (or piped) through one mirror will pass through this realm and emerge from the other mirror - even across dimensional boundaries.<BR>Unfortunately this realm is extremely hostile to mortal creatures like yourself so using these mirrors to transport living creatures is not yet possible.<BR>To link a pair of these magical mirrors you simply need to place one of them in a desired location. You then right-click with a second
tc.research_page.MIRROR.2=mirror on the one you placed, and the pair will become linked. You may then place the second wherever you wish and items thrown into one will be ejected out the other.<BR>Mirrors can only be linked in pairs, so while both are placed in the world and able to transmit items you cannot link them to another mirror. When you pick up a mirror it will remember the last partner it was linked with, allowing you to easily move it without having to relink it. While one of the paired mirrors is picked up, you may easily relink either of them.
tc.research_page.MIRROR.3=Transporting items through mirrors places stress on the magical glass and to prevent it from shattering the mirror automatically slows down the rate at which items is spit out the other side. The greater the instability, the more the transfer rate is slowed.<BR>This instability slowly lessens over time, but it can also be negated by relaying §7Ordo§0 vis directly to the mirror.
#
tc.research_name.MIRRORHAND=Magical Hand Mirror
tc.research_text.MIRRORHAND=Personal reflection
tc.research_page.MIRRORHAND.1=This magical hand mirror functions much the same way as other magical mirrors. You simply push items through the glass and they will pop out at the linked mirror.<BR>Simple right-click while holding the linked hand mirror and you will be able to place any items in your inventory into the looking glass to have them transported.<BR>The hand mirror can be linked to a mirror that is already paired with another.<BR>It should be noted that the hand mirror can only send items, not receive them.
#
tc.research_name.NODEJAR=Node in a Jar
tc.research_text.NODEJAR=For the Thaumaturgist on the go
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.1=Warded jars have proven themselves capable of storing all manner of mundane and mystical things, and you believe you have discovered another use for them - trapping aura nodes.<BR>By constructing a large version of a jar around a node and enacting the proper mystical formula with your wand, the node will become trapped inside the construct which will quickly shrink to a more manageable size. The jar can then be safely picked up and moved around, but the initial trapping spell does have a very good chance of damaging the node.<BR>The node is also frozen at the state it was in when trapped, and will  
tc.research_page.NODEJAR.2=never again be able to recharge any vis it was missing.<BR>While trapped the node is kept suspended and will not regenerate vis, nor can vis be drawn from it.<BR>It is possible to free the node from the jar by placing it in the world and clicking on it with a wand. The jar will be destroyed in the process.

tc.research_name.PAVETRAVEL=Paving Stone of Travel
tc.research_text.PAVETRAVEL=Easing your journey
tc.research_page.PAVETRAVEL.1=By altering the magical structure of arcane stone you are able to create a paving stone that adds new bounce to the step of anyone walking across it.<BR>Anything walking across it will have greater speed and agility for a couple of seconds.
#
tc.research_name.PAVEWARD=Paving Stone of Warding
tc.research_text.PAVEWARD=Keeping things out
tc.research_page.PAVEWARD.1=You have discovered a way of turning arcane stone blocks into mystical wards that will prevent most creatures from crossing them.<BR>It should be noted that these wards aren't always 100% foolproof and they cannot prevent other players from entering an area, but they keep most common threats at bay. They will also prevent golems from crossing them.<BR>For best results you need an unbroken line of them between the areas you wish to protect and the outside world.<BR>An active redstone signal will disable this block.
tc.research_page.PAVEWARD.2=The color of the runes above the paving stone indicates its current status.<BR>Purple runes show that it is currently preventing something from passing through.<BR>Blue runes indicates it has been deactivated with a redstone signal.<BR>Red runes shows that something is preventing it from fully warding an area and a gap exists where something might be able to pass through.

tc.research_name.WANDPED=Wand Recharge Pedestal
tc.research_text.WANDPED=Automated Wand Recharging
tc.research_page.WANDPED.1=Traveling around the countryside to recharge your wand is all good and well, but an automatic way of doing it would be much better.<BR>This specially crafted pedestal does just that - any wand placed in it will automatically draw vis from nearby nodes.<BR>Nodes will not be fully drained unless it is a poor quality wand crafted from iron or sticks.
#
tc.research_name.WANDPEDFOC=Compound Recharge Focus
tc.research_text.WANDPEDFOC=For everything a use
tc.research_page.WANDPEDFOC.1=In your travels you have discovered several nodes that contain compound aspects, but as yet there has been no way to tap this rich source of vis. Until now.<BR>This focus can be placed on top of a wand recharge pedestal which will allow any wand it contains to siphon off the compound vis from nearby nodes. Unfortunately each point of compound vis is broken down into a single point of primal vis and all the excess energy is lost. However it is a good start and you are sure you will discover better ways to access this resource.

tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.1=Shimmerleaf is often overshadowed by its mystical neighbor the Silverwood tree, but it has magical properties of its own.<BR>Like the Silverwood, Shimmerleaf flowers have purifying properties that lie dormant. You have found a way to awaken these properties and turn it into an Ethereal Bloom.<BR>Ethereal blooms slowly, but surely, restores land corrupted by mystical means to its former glory - this includes the blight known as Taint. While it cannot combat Taint directly, few tainted growths can survive outside their native environment for long and tend to die back.
tc.research_page.ETHEREALBLOOM.2=The flower only purifies the land bathed in its light out to a range of about 8 blocks.

They have incredible strength and can carry many times their own bodyweight.<BR>Pech are normally not aggressive, but when riled up they will band together and hunt down their attacker. Under normal conditions they avoid people at all costs.<BR>Pechs are notoriously avaricious, and will loot anything not nailed
tc.research_page.PECH.2=down, though they prefer precious things. It is said that if you feed this desire for material wealth it could be possible to befriend one. Once befriended they often carry wondrous objects that they might be willing to part with.<BR>It should be noted that such 'friendships' seldom last long.<BR><IMG>thaumcraft:textures/misc/research5.png:128:136:112:120:.75</IMG>

tc.research_name.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=Infusion Enchantment
tc.research_text.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT=Enchanting with Essentia
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.1=For ages now wizards and thaumaturges have been enchanting weapons, tools and armor by imbuing objects with their own life energy. While effective the process is tedious and the results are completely unpredictable. Your discovery of infusion crafting might have uncovered a solution to both those problems.<BR>You have discovered a way to enchant objects with an infusion altar. Simply place the item you wish to enchant on the central pedestal and supply the proper ingredients and essentia. 
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.2=It also requires some life essence in the form of experience, but much less than would be normally required to enchant something. This experience is drawn from anyone near the infusion altar so care should be taken.<BR>The essentia and experience costs listed in following recipes are for the first level of enchantment. To enchant an item to higher levels, simply perform the infusion process again - it can be repeated till the required enchantment has reached its maximum possible level. Essentia and experience cost are multiplied by the level of enchantment you are performing, so a level II enchant costs twice as much as a level I.
tc.research_page.INFUSIONENCHANTMENT.3=Additional costs might is also required if the item already contains enchants other than the one you are currently performing. This cost is usually around 10% per level of enchantment. So enchanting a sword with Fire Aspect I that already contains Smite III will cost 30% more.<BR>Instability also increases as the total number of enchantments on the object increases.<BR>Enchanting items with an infusion altar follows the normal rules for enchantment as it applies to what enchants can combine with others.

#
tc.research_name.TUBES=Essentia Tubes
tc.research_text.TUBES=Transportation of essentia
tc.research_page.TUBES.1=You have discovered several ways to transport essentia, but none of them has proven useful for large scale alchemical operations - until now.<BR>You have unlocked the key to creating stable and relatively leak-free tubing. While mundane chemicals can be transported in glass, certain types of essentia either dissolve or simply pass right through it. By wrapping the glass in iron and treating it with quicksilver you have managed to protect it from even the most volatile types of essentia. Gold fittings finish off the piping system and make it visually appealing.
tc.research_page.TUBES.2=The tubes can be connected to all manner of alchemical devices, though warded jars and alembics are their primary targets.<BR>Essentia flows through the tubes whenever something is connected to them that can accept it, like warded jars.<BR>Jars containing different kinds of essentia will only draw their kind of essentia towards them. Tubes however can only draw and transport one kind of essentia at a time - the highest drawing strength will take priority. Without the proper use of valves it is quite easy for a network of tubes to get gummed up. The use of valves is essential.<BR>When you see gasses being vented
tc.research_page.TUBES.3=from a tube, it means different kinds of suction are interfering with each other. The color gives a clue as to the types of suction.<LINE>The essentia valve acts much like a normal length of tubing, except it can be turned off by hand or a redstone signal. When this is done the flow off essentia through it will be cut off.<LINE>The Essentia Resonator is handy for troubleshooting your tube network. You can use it on a tube or other essentia using device to see what essentia it currently contains and the suction it is applying. 
tc.research_page.TUBES.4=Tubes can be connected and disconnected from their neighbors by clicking on a section of tubing with a wand.<BR>The wand can also be used to click on the central section to rotate certain tubes like the valve.
#
tc.research_name.CENTRIFUGE=Alchemical Centrifuge
tc.research_text.CENTRIFUGE=Taking things apart
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.1=The alchemical centrifuge is a wondrous invention that allows you to break essentia into its component parts.<BR>When compound essentia flows into the centrifuge from below it will be slowly broken down into the primal or compound essentia that it is made from. Only one of the components is created for each point of essentia broken down.<BR>The resulting essentia needs to be drawn from the top of the centrifuge. Because of the idiosyncrasies of the tube pressure system, it would be best to connect a §5Essentia Buffer§0 to the top of the centrifuge (see next page).
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.2=The essentia buffer allows you to store a limited amount of essentia - 8 points total, though it can be made up of any combination of essentia types. Like a jar it has suction, though it applies the minimum amount of suction possible (1).<BR>This means that is usually only able to draw essentia from an essentia source it is directly attached to. However tubes can be connect to all its sides, meaning that it is invaluable for getting essentia out of devices like the centrifuges that could contain variable types of essentia.<BR>You can attach bellows to the buffer - each attached bellows increases its suction by 32.
tc.research_page.CENTRIFUGE.3=Additionally you can toggle individual connections on and off as with a normal tube, but if you shift click a connection, it will choke the suction back to 1 (blue band) or 0 (red band) on that side.<BR>This allows for some interesting possibilities when routing essentia.

tc.research_name.TRAVELTRUNK=Traveling Trunk
tc.research_text.TRAVELTRUNK=Mobile Luggage
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.1=An extension of your golemancy research has led to a useful companion for any thaumaturge on the go: The Traveling Trunk.<BR>This wooden chest will happily hop after its master, always ready to provide a convenient storage space for anything you pick up.<BR>The traveling trunk is tough and can take a significant amount of beating. It is highly resistant to fire and cannot be harmed by falling.<BR>The trunk can follow its master everywhere - even distant dimensions. Should you wish it to stay put however, there is a convenient  button located in its interface
tc.research_page.TRAVELTRUNK.2=which will make it remain in its current position.<BR>The traveling trunk slowly heals itself over time, but you can also feed it all manner of food to speed up this process.<BR>Like normal golems, the trunk can be picked up by left-clicking with a golemancer's bell. It will drop all items in its inventory of you do so. Shift-clicking will also cause it to drop any upgrades you have applied to it with the normal loss chance.<BR>It can accept a single upgrade like normal golems, but they grant unique abilities to the trunk.

tc.research_text.LAMPGROWTH=Encouraging things to grow
tc.research_page.LAMPGROWTH.1=Unlike the Arcane lamp from which it is made, the Lamp of Growth does not cast much light unless it is provided with Herba essentia. If this is done any plants which grow where its light shines the brightest will grow much faster than normal.<BR>Essentia can be fed to the lamp by attaching it directly to an essentia piping system.

tc.research_page.LAMPFERTILITY.1=Any living creatures bathed in the gentle pink glow of this lamp is immediately placed in a much more romantic mood. If they are able they will seek others of their kind to mate.<BR>This lamp will have no effect if there is 8 or more of a particular species already present.<BR>It requires Victus essentia to function which can be fed to the lamp by attaching it directly to an essentia piping system.

tc.research_name.JARVOID=Void Jar
tc.research_text.JARVOID=Too much essentia? Impossible!
tc.research_page.JARVOID.1=Void jars function much the same as normal warded jars with one important difference - even when full they are still able to accept essentia, but the excess essentia is simply lost. This allows you to always have some essentia of that type available, but get rid of any excess that may build up.<BR>Like normal jars, void jars can accept labels, but their suction with a label is less than that of a normal labeled jar (about halfway between unlabeled and labeled jar).

tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.1=§nFiltered essentia tubes§r work like normal tubes, except it is possible to mark them with labels. When marked they will restrict essentia flow through them to what they have been marked with.<BR>Shift-clicking on them with an empty hand will remove the label.
tc.research_page.TUBEFILTER.2=§nRestricted essentia tubes§r work like normal tubes, except they halve the any suction passing through them.<LINE>§nDirectional essentia tubes§r only accept suction from one direction. The blue markings indicate the direction from which suction will be accepted.

tc.research_text.MIRRORESSENTIA=Essentia where you need it
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.1=Magical mirrors are very useful for transporting items over long distances, but what if that same principle can be applied to essentia? You think you have discovered a way to do just that.<BR>Essentia mirrors, like their name implies, can transport essentia in the same way that magic mirrors transport items. There are a few important limitations however.<BR>You cannot pipe essentia directly into the mirrors - they are only able to transport essentia that has been drawn from a source towards something like an Infusion Matrix.    
tc.research_page.MIRRORESSENTIA.2=In effect the mirrors allow these things to draw essentia from sources via the mirror.

#
tc.research_name.THAUMATORIUM=Automated Alchemy
tc.research_text.THAUMATORIUM=Alchemy for the masses
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.1=Up to now alchemy has been somewhat of a hit and miss affair - miscounted aspects, degrading essentia and ingredients that require manual labor to mix. This is finally a thing of the past.<BR>The Thaumatorium is a marvelous invention that allows a thaumaturge to select which formula to use and what catalysts to add. It then automatically draws essentia from available sources using tubes. As long as there is a supply of catalyst it produces the required object perfectly, every time.<BR>The crucible that forms its base does not require water, but a heat source is still needed.
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.2=When you access this device you will see several slots. The top-left slot is where you place the catalyst. Once you have done this you will be able to choose which recipe you wish to craft with that catalyst from a list of possibilities in the top right slot.<BR>The bottom bar shows the essentia required in the order they will be required. It will also display progress bars once the machine is in operation.<BR>The created object is ejected out the front of the device or into an inventory placed in front of the ejection port.
tc.research_page.THAUMATORIUM.3=Normally a Thaumatorium can only have one active formula, but by attaching a Mnemonic Matrix to its side you can increase the number of formulas it can keep track.<BR>Each matrix increases the number of formulas by 2. 
#
tc.research_name.RUNICARMOR=Runic Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICARMOR=Shields up!
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.1=Your research into protective magics have led you to discover Runic Shielding. This is not armor in the traditional sense, but a collection of charms, rings and similar protective baubles worn with your everyday clothes.<BR>These devices create a barrier of magical energy that wards out most types of damage. The shielding has a pool of hit points from which damage is subtracted first, protecting the wearer from all harm. Once this pool is depleted the wearer starts taking damage as normal.
tc.research_page.RUNICARMOR.2=The pool replenishes over time and requires §2Terra§0 and §eAer§0 vis to replenish its charge which it draws from carried wands.<BR>The armor offers no protection from damage suffered due to drowning, starvation or similar environmental hazards.<BR>Due to its nature the armor cannot be enchanted by normal means, but you are sure there are ways to improve its effectiveness - you just need to discover them.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICAUGMENTATION=Runic Shielding Augmentation
tc.research_text.RUNICAUGMENTATION=Shields to maximum!
tc.research_page.RUNICAUGMENTATION.1=Rings, amulets and girdles with runic shielding is all good and well, but surely you can apply this protective enchantment to other things?<BR>Of course you can! By utilizing the magic of Thaumaturgy(c) (patent pending), you are able to add runic shielding to most magically stable pieces of armor.<BR>'Magically stable' items are those crafted from thaumium, enchanted fabric or similarly magical materials.<BR>Only a single charge of runic shielding is added to the item, but you can enchant an item multiple times. This is expensive and
tc.research_page.RUNICAUGMENTATION.2=the amount of ingredients and essentia required will increase with each level. The Salis Mundus required will equal the level of shielding you want, and the essentia cost will increase exponentially.<BR>You can enchant existing runic items like Rings of Shielding as well, however the cost is calculated based on their existing runic charge making it an exceptionally expensive process.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICCHARGED=Charged Ring of Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICCHARGED=Charge for the Charge Ring!
tc.research_page.RUNICCHARGED.1=This is a specialized version of the Ring of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the ring it is based on, but increases the recharge time of runic shielding by 25%.<BR>You can wear more than one of these rings, effectively halving the normal recharge time.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICHEALING=Revitalizing Ring of Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICHEALING=Go ahead, I can take it.
tc.research_page.RUNICHEALING.1=This is a specialized version of the Ring of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the ring it is based on, but when your runic shielding is breached it will release a pulse of regenerative energy that will last for a few seconds.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once every 20 seconds.
#
tc.research_name.RUNICKINETIC=Kinetic Girdle of Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICKINETIC=Hehe, you're going to regret that.
tc.research_page.RUNICKINETIC.1=This is a specialized version of the Girdle of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the girdle it is based on, but when your shielding is breached a detonation of kinetic energy will be released damaging and shoving back anything nearby.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once every 20 seconds.

tc.research_name.RUNICEMERGENCY=Amulet of Emergency Shielding
tc.research_text.RUNICEMERGENCY=You can't get me that easily.
tc.research_page.RUNICEMERGENCY.1=This is a specialized version of the Amulet of Shielding.<BR>It has slightly less charge than the amulet it is based on, but when your shielding is breached this upgrade will instantly add 8 charge to your shielding amount.<BR>This effect cannot trigger more than once a minute.
#
tc.research_name.WARDEDARCANA=Warded Arcana
tc.research_text.WARDEDARCANA=Controlling access
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.1=Some experimentation has led to an interesting discovery - the ability to imprint memories in inanimate objects. Your first attempt at using the discovery is doors, pressure plates and other blocks that remember who placed them.<BR>The door can only be removed with a wand by the person who placed it. Additionally the door will refuse to open for anyone but its owner. The owner can also craft iron or gold keys that will grant others access to this door.<BR>By crafting an iron key and clicking on the door, you will link the key to that door. 
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.2=You can then give the key to another person and they will be able to use it on the door to gain permanent permission to open it. They will still not be able to break the door, or grant anyone else access. For that you need the gold key.<BR>The gold key serves much the same function as the iron key, except they can also grant other people iron key access to that door. Only the original owner of the door can hand out gold key access. They are also not able to remove the door with a wand. Only the original owner will be able to do that.
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.3=This pressure plate has a few novel features.<BR>Firstly it has 3 settings that can be toggled by right-clicking on it: It can trigger on everything (like a wooden pressure plate), just you, or everything except you.<BR>Secondly, like all other warded items only you can remove it.<BR>Lastly it can be linked to other players with the use of keys. These pressure plates can be used to open arcane doors as long as someone with access to the plate has access to the door as well.
tc.research_page.WARDEDARCANA.4=Warded glass is a simple cosmetic block, but like other warded objects it cannot be broken except by the person who placed it.<BR>Keys cannot be used to give other users access.
#
tc.research_name.VISAMULET=Vis Storage
tc.research_text.VISAMULET=Waste not, Want not
tc.research_page.VISAMULET.1=Most of the time a single wand is more than enough for any thaumaturge, but there are occasions that the vis it stores just isn't enough. Carrying more than one wand would solve this, but experimentation has shown that there is another way.<BR>By crafting an amulet capable of storing vis, you will be able to recharge wands and other items in the field while it is being worn.<BR>Your success has been mixed however. You can only recharge wands while holding them in your own hand and even then the recharge rate is slow. 
tc.research_page.VISAMULET.2=However the amulet is able to act as a good power source for other things like the Repair enchant or runic shielding.<BR>The amulet can only be recharged in a wand pedestal or from nearby vis relays.
#
tc.research_name.NODESTABILIZER=Node Stabilizer
tc.research_text.NODESTABILIZER=Node Therapy
tc.research_page.NODESTABILIZER.1=This handy device has several beneficial effects if placed below a node.<BR>Firstly it prevents the node from draining vis from other nodes, or being drained in turn. Secondly it prevents unstable nodes from losing their vis and it has a tiny chance of eventually removing the unstable condition completely. Lastly it has a very, very small chance of turning fading nodes into pale nodes.<BR>This requires power however and the Node Stabilizer draws this from the node itself. It does not draw enough to reduce the vis of the node, but it does halve its normal recharge rate.
tc.research_page.NODESTABILIZER.2=Applying a redstone signal will switch the stabilizer off.
#
tc.research_name.NODESTABILIZERADV=Advanced Node Stabilizer
tc.research_text.NODESTABILIZERADV=Selective stabilization
tc.research_page.NODESTABILIZERADV.1=Advanced Node Stabilizers perform all the functions of the lesser versions with a few major differences.<BR>Firstly they still prevent lesser nodes from having their vis drained, but it does allow stabilized nodes to drain the vis from lesser ones.<BR>Secondly it has a higher chance to improve unstable and fading nodes.<BR>Unfortunately this costs a lot more power from the stabilized node - still not enough to drain vis from it, but even the brightest node will have its recharge rate almost completely negated.
#
tc.research_name.GOLEMFETTER=Golem Fetter
tc.research_text.GOLEMFETTER=Making them behave
tc.research_page.GOLEMFETTER.1=This simple device allows a golemancer to bring their golems to a temporary halt.<BR>If this block is activated with a redstone signal any golem that passes over it will come to complete standstill and cease its current task.<BR>Once this block is deactivated the golem will once again go about its business.
#
tc.research_name.VISPOWER=Harnessing Vis
tc.research_text.VISPOWER=Power to the People
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.1=Without vis nodes thaumaturges would not even be able to perform the simplest of tasks, but the nodes themselves have several limitations that make their use impractical for extensive operations. Foremost amongst these limitations is the fact that they are easily depleted and it takes quite some time for them to once again gather energy from mystical source they are connected to.<BR>You think you may have found a way around that limitation. In effect nodes are tiny gateways to a mysterious font of mystical energy around which the energy slowly accumulates in the form of Vis. The gateway is so small that only a tiny
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.2=amount of energy leaks into our reality. By levering open this doorway you can cause vis to pour forth in a torrent.<BR>This is even more dangerous than it sounds however and careful steps must be taken during the entire process.<BR>Firstly the node needs to be stabilized during the entire process. Once that is done you need to craft and place a §lNode Transducer§r above the node. When you apply a redstone signal to the transducer the node will begin converting to an energized node and quickly lose its stored vis in the process.<BR>The process takes some time, but when it is done the node will
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.3=change into an energized node. Caution should be taken to keep both the stabilizer and transducer active from now on.<LINE>Energized nodes no longer store or recharge vis, nor can vis be drawn from them with a wand or other means. Instead they produce a steady supply of §lCV§r (centi-vis, or a hundredth of a vis) each tick. This energy can be tapped by placing vis relays near the energized node.<BR>Each relay acts as a conduit for CV and any number of relays can be placed within 8 blocks of an energized node. Relays also transfer energy to each other allowing you to create a network that transports vis to
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.4=anything that needs it, like the Infernal Furnace.<BR>Relays use a branching system, so each relay can have only one source (either another relay, or an energized node), but may have multiple child relays that branch off it.<BR>You can also 'tune' a relay to one of the primal aspects by using an appropriate vis shard on it. Clicking on it with a wand will also cycle through the possible attunements. This does not limit what vis can flow through that relay, but does prevent it from connecting to any other relay except untuned ones or ones tuned to the same primal. 
tc.research_page.VISPOWER.5=The amount of energy a node produces per tick is finite so attaching too many devices to a single source might exceed the amount of CV it can produce.<LINE>It is possible to turn an energized node back into a normal node. Simply cut the redstone signal to the transducer and it slowly turn it back into a normal node. Caution should be taken however since the node will be completely drained of vis and thus runs the risk of being damaged.
#
tc.research_name.VISCHARGERELAY=Vis Charging Relay
tc.research_text.VISCHARGERELAY=Arcane Crafting Simplified
tc.research_page.VISCHARGERELAY.1=An annoyance for any thaumaturge that performs regular arcane crafting is to constantly keep his wand charged.<BR>Now that you have found a way to draw vis directly from nodes you are able to craft a Vis Charging Relay. This functions like a normal relay, but is designed to be placed on top of an arcane crafting table. It will draw vis from the relay and recharge wands placed in the table.<BR>The only drawback is that it recharges much slower than it would from a wand recharging pedestal or doing it by hand. 
#
tc.research_name.WARP=Warp, Flux and all things bad
tc.research_text.WARP=Everything has a price
tc.research_page.WARP.1=§nWarp§r<BR>Many believe man was not meant to meddle with magic, and nothing gives more credence to this than the existence of Warp.<BR>Researching forbidden magics or crafting objects of a questionable nature tends to distort a thaumaturge's view of reality, twisting both their minds and their bodies. This effect is called Warp.<BR>While some warp gained is temporary and will fade over time, there is no known way to get rid of permanent Warp once it is gained and a thaumaturge who chooses to ignore the dangers in the pursuit of power
tc.research_page.WARP.2=often finds himself on a slippery slope.<BR>Warp usually manifests as minor lapses in concentration, physical pain or hallucinations.<BR>These are more than merely mental though, as the visions sometimes impart useful knowledge or seeming hallucinations prove to be frighteningly real.
tc.research_page.WARP.3=§nFlux§r<BR>If Warp is the mental manifestation of magic gone wrong, then Flux is its physical manifestation.<BR>Flux can manifest in three ways: a liquid, a gas and a physical malady. The first two manifestations are considered annoyances by most thaumaturges and is often the result of wasteful use of magic. It is not particularly hard to clean up, but coming into contact with it often causes the third manifestation: Flux Flu<BR>Flux Flu is not particularly dangerous, but while a thaumaturge is suffering from it he finds it difficult to focus vis which often leads to increased vis usage to get something done.
#
tc.research_name.BATHSALTS=Purifying Bath Salts
tc.research_text.BATHSALTS=Stress relief for the mind
tc.research_page.BATHSALTS.1=Warp is a danger for even the most careful of thaumaturges. For those that have done a bit too much dabbling Warp effects are probably more than just an annoyance. Purifying Bath Salts help with that.<BR>Simply tossing these salts into water will turn the water into a silvery, purifying liquid that sooths away the stresses of the day and brings temporary relief from the effects of Warp. It should be noted however the more warp a thaumaturge suffers from, the shorter the duration of this protection.<BR>The salts are quite fragile and will soon dissolve if tossed around haphazardly. 
#
tc.research_name.LIQUIDDEATH=Liquid Death
tc.research_text.LIQUIDDEATH=For external use only
tc.research_page.LIQUIDDEATH.1=This liquid is so dangerously toxic that virtually nothing can prevent it from dissolving flesh, bone and even harder substances. Nothing alive or that even displays the semblance of life can survive it.<BR>Apart from obvious practical applications, this vile substance has another interesting property: Any essentia a dissolved creature possessed form into crystals that can be harvested.<BR>I will leave it to the reader's imagination what uses those crystals can be put to.

tc.research_name.ARMORFORTRESS=Thaumium Fortress Armor
tc.research_text.ARMORFORTRESS=Nothing is getting in
tc.research_page.ARMORFORTRESS.1=Thaumium armor has many things to recommend it, but its basic construction leaves it inferior to diamond armor. By improving the construction process and complexity you have found a way to create armor of exceptional craftsmanship, durability and strength.<BR>Each individual piece of Thaumium Fortress armor has the same protective properties as diamond armor, but has greater durability and offers additional protection against magic and fire.<BR>The biggest benefit however is that the individual armor pieces is designed and constructed to be worn together: Each additional
tc.research_page.ARMORFORTRESS.2=piece of this armor worn increases the overall protection offered by all other pieces and improves its visual appeal.<BR>As with most objects constructed from thaumium, the armor is easy to enchant.

tc.research_page.VOIDMETAL.1=By infusing magic into metal you had managed to create Thaumium. It was a worthy discovery, but the time has come to leave thaumium to amateurs and dabblers.<BR>A strange and half-remembered dream has given you the urge to try something... different. What if you infuse metal with more than just magic, but with the very essence where magic is drawn from: Darkness and the Void that dwells between the stars.<BR>The resulting metal is disturbingly slick and warm to the touch. It is almost as soft as gold making it easy to work, but
tc.research_page.VOIDMETAL.2=when struck it becomes as hard as thaumium and sometimes even harder. More impressively all but the most devastating damage soon repairs itself as the metal slowly flows back into place.<BR>The only downside is that it isn't as easy to enchant as thaumium, but still compares favorably to mundane materials like iron.<BR>You have discovered that care must be taken when handling the metal - being harmed by it seems to temporarily sap your strength.

The liquid will fill a 5x5 area above the location where the machine is placed.<BR>Additionally, you have found that it can be used to pump nearly any liquid you can fill it with.

tc.research_text.OCULUS=I will show them, I will show them all!
tc.research_page.OCULUS.1=It was all so simple - you are amazed the Crimson Cultists have never discovered this.<BR>To perform the ritual you simply need to place four Eldritch Eyes on the specially marked keystone found at one of the strange altars where you first discovered the cult. The sinister node above the keystone must remain intact.<BR>Once this is done it is a simple matter of infusing a large amount of primal vis into the keystone with a wand - 100 units of each should be sufficient.

tc.research_page.ESSENTIARESERVOIR.1=Most types of essentia are fairly volatile and care must be taken in its storage - that is why most thaumaturges use warded jars. You, however, are not most thaumaturges.<BR>Using the wonderful new substance called void metal, you have discovered a way to greatly improve the storage of essentia. Essentia reservoirs are capable of storing up to 256 essentia in any combination.<BR>Potentially disastrous mixing of the different essentia types is prevented by having dynamically reshaping compartments crafted from the new metal.
tc.research_page.ESSENTIARESERVOIR.2=Like jars, the reservoirs can only be accessed from one side, though you can choose how they are orientated. Unfortunately they cannot be emptied or filled by hand so you need to rely on tubes or golems for that.<BR>Picking up a reservoir while filled is, um, inadvisable.<BR>You were so pleased with this discovery that you showed it off to some of your fellow thaumaturges. Strangely, most of them dived for cover even after you assured them the constant sound of metal under incredible stress is perfectly normal.

tc.research_name.ESSENTIACRYSTAL=Essentia Crystallization 
tc.research_text.ESSENTIACRYSTAL=Hard currency or liquid assets?
tc.research_page.ESSENTIACRYSTAL.1=You have nearly mastered the art of turning concrete objects into liquid essentia, so doing the reverse is a simple matter.<BR>The essentia crystallizer draws in liquid essentia from a pipe network and slowly converts it into small shards of crystalline essentia. Crystalline essentia is safe to handle and very stable.<BR>The Crystallizer either ejects the crystals into the world or into a container. It can be disabled with a redstone signal.<BR>Supplying it with terra vis will greatly increase its speed.

tc.research_name.BANNERS=Banners 
tc.research_text.BANNERS=Caution: For decorative purposes only
tc.research_page.BANNERS.1=Sometimes a thaumaturge doesn't need to create something that shakes the very foundations of reality - sometimes he just wants something pleasing to the eye.<BR>You have developed a simple enchantment that allows you to apply thaumaturgical symbols to banners. You do so by simply clicking with a phial of essentia on a banner you crafted and the symbol will be emblazoned on it. Shift-clicking on the banner will remove the symbol.
#
tc.research_name.BOTTLETAINT=Bottled Taint 
tc.research_text.BOTTLETAINT=Why would you want this?
tc.research_page.BOTTLETAINT.1=Cleaning Taint is one thing, but ever considered spreading it?<BR>By concentrating and collecting the essence of taint into a bottle it is simply a matter of dropping it somewhere to create a patch of taint. It is up to you to decide why you would want to do this. 
#
tc.research_name.FOCALMANIPULATION=Focal Manipulation 
tc.research_text.FOCALMANIPULATION=Wand foci remade
tc.research_page.FOCALMANIPULATION.1=Wand foci are capable of amazing feats, but they aren't very flexible. A single focus is seldom capable of performing more than a single function.<BR>You have discovered a way to upgrade basic foci to alter the way they manipulate magic. You simply need to place a focus in a Focal Manipulator and choose the upgrade you wish to apply to it. You also need to provide it with vis from relays and spend experience points to get the process started, but after that it is a simple matter of waiting.<BR>Each focus can be upgraded up to five times, 
tc.research_page.FOCALMANIPULATION.2=but each rank is doubles the cost.<BR>While some upgrades can be applied multiple times or at any rank, many foci have upgrades that can only be applied at certain ranks or only if certain requisite upgrades had been taken at lower ranks. Experimentation is encouraged.<BR>Upgrades are permanent - you are not aware of any method to remove unwanted upgrades so care must be taken when choosing them.

tc.research_name.PRIMPEARL=Primordial Pearl 
tc.research_text.PRIMPEARL=What came before
tc.research_page.PRIMPEARL.1=For the first time you find yourself with a puzzle that you do not think can be solved.<BR>This object contains pure primal aspects, but they possess properties unlike what you consider normal, everyday primal aspects. You have a few theories why this could be:<BR>Firstly this "pearl" could be the remnants of primal matter that was created at the dawn of reality - elementary magic that existed before it mingled and merged into compound aspects.<BR>Alternatively it could be primal matter from a place that does not conform to the known rules of
tc.research_page.PRIMPEARL.2=magic as you have come to understand it. You are not sure which explanation is more worrying.<BR>Either way, the pearl is a potent artifact containing vast magical power and nearly unlimited potential.<BR>It is time you start putting it to use.
#
tc.research_name.PRIMNODE=Primordial Node Manipulation 
tc.research_text.PRIMNODE=Just rub them together and see what happens
tc.research_page.PRIMNODE.1=You have developed a bit of a wild theory that might be worth exploring. Why not bring a primordial pearl into contact with an aura node?<BR>Sure, bringing two such sources of raw magical energy into contact with each other might be catastrophic, but their interaction could also be highly... interesting.<BR>While anyone can do this, you are sure that completing this research has slightly improved your chances of getting a good result. Very slightly.
#
tc.research_name.ADVALCHEMYFURNACE=Advanced Alchemical Furnace 
tc.research_text.ADVALCHEMYFURNACE=Essentia Creation Simplified
tc.research_page.ADVALCHEMYFURNACE.1=The standard alchemical furnace is fairly slow and requires fuel to operate. While neither of those are particularly difficult obstacles to you, the fact that it is unable to process large sources of essentia is something that can not be ignored. Unfortunately the instability of the essentia slurry it creates makes it dangerous to gather too much of it in one location.<BR>With the discovery of Primordial Pearls you have found a solution to that problem - The Advanced Alchemical Furnace.<BR>Using alchemical constructs that have been strengthened with void   
tc.research_page.ADVALCHEMYFURNACE.2=metal and exposed to a primordial pearl's strange energies much more slurry can be processed at once and at much greater speeds. The pearl is not consumed during the crafting process.<BR>Instead of fuel, heat is generated by ignis vis and instead of relying on heat alone perditio vis breaks down objects almost instantly. Lastly aqua vis keeps everything running smoothly and prevents the slurry from settling and causing problems.<BR>The machine requires a considerable amount of heat to function and requires a constant supply of ignis vis even when not operating. Perditio and aqua vis is only used when the machine is smelting.

tc.research_name.FLUXSCRUB=Flux Scrubber 
tc.research_text.FLUXSCRUB=A boon for the messy thaumaturge
tc.research_page.FLUXSCRUB.1=Even the most skilled thaumaturge occasionally leaves a mess in the form of flux. It is a nuisance everyone has to deal with, but this machine removes the drudgery involved.<BR>The flux scrubber, when powered with aer vis, will slowly remove any form of flux within 16 blocks of where it is placed. What is more, it is able to reclaim a small portion of the magic that makes up the flux in the form of praecantatio essentia.<BR>It's internal buffer is very small and it will continue operating even when full, so it must be emptied if you wish to reclaim all the essentia.
#
tc.research_name.ENTEROUTER=The Outer Lands 
tc.research_text.ENTEROUTER=We are not in Kansas anymore
tc.research_page.ENTEROUTER.1=You are not quite sure what you were expecting when you stepped through the Oculus, but this strange structure of crumbling stone and twisted passageways was not it.<BR>Something is not quite right here - this structure was not designed for any practical purpose you can discern... unless that purpose was for it to be a deadly maze.<BR>Strange energies abound and your magic seems to act strangely in this alien environment. Even the other denizens you encounter seem out of place here.
#
tc.research_name.OUTERREV=Revelations in the Outer Lands 
tc.research_text.OUTERREV=Things are not what they seem
tc.research_page.OUTERREV.1=Your suspicions have been confirmed. This is not the home of the race you have come to call the Eldritch. This place is something else entirely and you do not believe it exists in what you understand as being "reality" - it is as much a mental construct as a physical one, but what mind can contain this?<BR>You have been able to decipher only a small number of the symbols, but you are sure this place is a trap - a place to test visitors and weed out the weak. For what purpose you are not sure.
#
tc.research_name.SINSTONE=Sinister Lodestone 
tc.research_text.SINSTONE=Do you dare follow it?
tc.research_page.SINSTONE.1=You have made an interesting discovery during your study of nodes. Different kinds of nodes emit varying types of radiant energy, but none are quite as distinct as that of Sinister nodes.<BR>The energy emitted by Sinister nodes is quite unique and simple to track. By infusing a piece of flint you think you can create a simple scrying device that will light up whenever it is pointed towards such a node.<BR>The range is limited, but it is a worthwhile invention since you have often found Sinister nodes in the most interesting of places.
#
tc.research_name.PRIMALCRUSHER=Primal Crusher 
tc.research_text.PRIMALCRUSHER=Breaking all the things
tc.research_page.PRIMALCRUSHER.1=The theory behind infusion crafting is simple - infuse a single object with essentia and the properties of other objects. There are limits however, but it seems with the discovery of the primordial pearl these limits are becoming less and less.<BR>As an experiment you tried infusing the properties of completely different objects into the pearl with suprising success. The Primal Crusher is the first practical application of this discovery.<BR>By combining a Shovel of the Earthmover and a Pickaxe of the Core with their void metal counterparts you created a
tc.research_page.PRIMALCRUSHER.2=tool of unrivaled destructive capabilities that has most of the features of its component pieces.<BR>The Primal Crusher can mine through earth and stone with equal ease and does so in a 3x3 area. Like the Pickaxe of the Core it occasionally mines native clusters instead of raw ore.<BR>It repairs itself over time, has high enchantability and serves as a relatively good weapon in a pinch.<BR>Unfortunately it seems purely destructive in nature and has lost the construction and detection abilities of its parent tools.
