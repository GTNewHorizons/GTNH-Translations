# << portable shower >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.portableshower=Portable Shower
tc.research_text.warptheory.portableshower=A more mundane way to clean your mind
research.warptheory.portableshower=You realized you still feel crazy when wearing your favorite armor. So you have thought long and hard about the solution for that.....when you were tinkering with your spa, you suddenly had a revelation to yourself, "Why would I not just bath permanently to feel fresh the whole time?" and so, you created this simple amulet, it brews arcane spa water for you, using natural essentia with some vis from the environment.

# << hunk of something >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.something=무언가의 덩어리
tc.research_text.warptheory.something=Definitely not something pleasant
research.warptheory.warpsomething=By chance you realized that many simple meats could be transmuted into something else if they were exposed to eldritch energy. It's... probably not a good idea to look too closely at the result.

# << Impure tear >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.cleanserminor=불순한 눈물
tc.research_text.warptheory.cleanserminor=Magical-ish Medicine
research.warptheory.warpcleanserminor=You've dealt with warp long enough, time to try to find a way to get rid of it. You decide to try mixing together some cleansing type items you've found.<BR>You succeeded, but the effect only works when you have a decent amount of it, so you can't get rid of it all. But at least you can avoid the worst effects, unlike Bob who had a wither spawn and blow up his base. Poor Bob. (You need 50+ warp for it to work, and it removes 5 warp)<BR>You suspect that if you had better materials, you could make a better version.

# << pure tear >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.cleanser=순수한 눈물

research.warptheory.warpcleanser=By combining the curative properties of Ghast Tears, the magical energy of Salis Mundus, and the stabilizing properties of crystals, you've discovered a means of purging negative magical energy from the body.<BR>The process is not without drawbacks, though, as all that energy has to go somewhere.

# << purification talisman >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.amulet=Purification Talisman
tc.research_text.warptheory.amulet=More than a simple good luck charm
research.warptheory.amulet=You've discovered a process by which the purifying properties of Pure Tears can be channeled over time without the requisite indigestion they cause.<BR>By simply setting two opposing tears into an amulet and imbuing it with certain magic, an accessory which continuously siphons off negative magical energy into the environment is produced.

# << litmus paper >>
tc.research_name.warptheory.paper=아케인 리트머스 종이
tc.research_text.warptheory.paper=Almost scientific
research.warptheory.paper=You've decided that you'll need something somewhat more accurate than counting the strange events that happen around you to gauge the buildup of negative magical energy in your body.<BR>By imbuing some paper with Salis Mundus and the essence of water, you've created a means to get a read on just how much danger you've been exposing yourself to.
